<h1>The Automobile Girls Along the Hudson</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE UNEXPECTED ALWAYS HAPPENS</h2>
<p>
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd make a pretty good housemaid,‚Äù
said Barbara, on her knees,
energetically polishing the floor of the
cottage parlor.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOnly housemaids don‚Äôt wear gloves and all-over
aprons and mobcaps,‚Äù replied Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd they don‚Äôt protect their skins from dust
with cold cream,‚Äù added Barbara, teasingly.
‚ÄúDo they, Molliekins?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù replied Mollie, ‚Äúduty and beauty
rhyme, and every woman ought to try and keep
her looks, according to the beauty pages in all
the papers.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPoor old Molliekins!‚Äù exclaimed her sister.
‚ÄúCrowsfeet and gray hair at fifteen!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGoing on sixteen,‚Äù corrected Mollie, as she
gave a finishing rub to the mahogany center table,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
a relic of more prosperous days, and flourished
an old, oily stocking that made an excellent
polisher. ‚ÄúBut the papers do say that automobiling
is very harmful to the complexion and
the face should be protected by layers of cold
cream and powder, and a veil on top of that.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to take the chance,‚Äù laughed
Barbara, ‚Äúif ever I get another one.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI suppose Ruth is so busy getting ready for
her six weeks‚Äô trip abroad that she won‚Äôt have
much time for her ‚Äòbubble‚Äô this August,‚Äù observed
Mollie. ‚ÄúBut, dear knows, we can‚Äôt
complain. There never was a rich girl who
knew how to make other people happy as well as
she does. Sometimes I think she is really a fairy
princess, disguised as a human being, who is
just gratifying her desire to do nice things for
girls like us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, she is no fairy,‚Äù commented Barbara.
‚ÄúThat is why we love her so. She is just a
jolly, nice girl and as human as anybody.
When she asked us to go to Newport it was because
she really wanted us. She has often told
me, since, that she had been planning the trip
for months, but the girls she knew were not exactly
the kind who would have fallen into such
a scheme. Gladys Le Baron would never have
done, you see, at that time, because she always
wanted Harry Townsend hanging about.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
Harry Townsend, our readers will recall, appeared
in a former volume of this series, ‚ÄúThe
Automobile Girls at Newport.‚Äù He was the
famous youth known to the police as ‚ÄúThe
Boy Raffles,‚Äù whose mysterious thefts were
the puzzle of the society world. It was Barbara
Thurston, by her grit and intelligence,
who finally brought the criminal to justice,
though not before Newport had been completely
bewildered by a number of inexplicable jewelry
robberies.
</p>
<p>
Following the visit to Newport came another
delightful trip to the Berkshire Hills. The romantic
rescue of a little girl whose birth had
been concealed from her rich white relatives by
her Indian grandmother; Mollie Thurston lost in
an unexplored forest; the thrilling race between
an air ship and an automobile‚Äîthese and other
exciting adventures were described in the second
volume of the series entitled ‚ÄúThe Automobile
Girls in the Berkshires.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow hot it is!‚Äù continued Bab. ‚ÄúSuppose
we have some lemonade. These forest fire
mists are really fine ashes and they make me
quite thirsty.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
She polished away vigorously while Mollie
tripped off to make a cooling drink in the spotless
little kitchen. Except for the tinkle of ice
against glass the house was very still. Outside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
not a breeze was stirring, and the meadows
were draped in a curious, smoky mist. The sun
hung like a red ball in the sky; the air was hot
and heavy. The flowers in the garden borders
drooped their heads in spite of persistent and
frequent waterings. Three months‚Äô drought
had almost made a desert of Kingsbridge. The
neat little scrap of a lawn was turning brown
in patches, like prematurely gray hair, Barbara
said. Even the birds were silent, and Mollie‚Äôs
cherished family of bantams, a hen, a rooster
and one chick, crouched listlessly in the shadow
of the hedge.
</p>
<p>
Just then the stillness was broken by the distant
crunch-crunch of an automobile. But the
girls were too intent on what they were doing
to take any notice until it stopped at
their own front gate, and the sound of gay
laughter and voices floated up the walk. Mollie
and Barbara rushed together to the front
porch.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ruth herself!‚Äù they cried in the same
breath, running down the steps without stopping
to remove their long gingham aprons and
dusting caps. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs mother, too,‚Äù exclaimed
Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd Mr. Stuart and Aunt Sallie, all complete!‚Äù
cried Barbara.
</p>
<p>
In a moment the three girls were engaged in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
a sort of triangular embrace while the others
looked smilingly on.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, young ladies,‚Äù said Mr. Stuart, ‚Äúare
those automobile coats you‚Äôre wearing, and bonnets,
too?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think they would do pretty well for motoring,‚Äù
replied Barbara, ‚Äúthey are specially made
for keeping out the dust.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThey are just as cute as they can be,‚Äù said
loyal Ruth, who was too tender-hearted to let
her friends be teased.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut where on earth did you come from,
Ruth?‚Äù asked Mollie. ‚ÄúWe were just talking
about you a moment ago. We thought, of
course, you were still in Denver, and lo and behold!
you appear in person in Kingsbridge.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, papa had a call East,‚Äù replied Ruth,
bubbling with suppressed joy, ‚Äúand I had a call,
too. Papa‚Äôs was business and mine was‚Äîwell,
just to call on you.‚Äù By that time they had
reached the cool, half-darkened little parlor
whose bare floor and mahogany furniture reflected
their faces in the recently polished
surfaces.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOho!‚Äù cried Mr. Stuart. ‚ÄúI see now where
Queen Mab and her fairies have been working
in their pinafores and caps.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTake them off now, girlies,‚Äù said Mrs.
Thurston, ‚Äúand get a pitcher of ice water. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
know our friends must be thirsty after their
dusty ride.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But Mollie, who had already disappeared,
came back in a few minutes bearing a large tray
of glasses and a tall glass pitcher against whose
sides cracked ice tinkled musically.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most delightful sound I‚Äôve heard
to-day,‚Äù exclaimed Mr. Stuart, and even Aunt
Sallie took a second glass without much urging.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhere is our little Indian Princess from
the Berkshire Hills?‚Äù asked Mr. Stuart suddenly.
‚ÄúOne of my reasons for coming East
was to see Eunice. Ruth says she is the prettiest,
little brown bird that ever flew down from
a mountain to live in a gilded cage. What have
you done with her, Mrs. Thurston?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have had to give her up, Mr. Stuart,‚Äù Mrs.
Thurston replied, sadly. ‚ÄúAnd I was beginning
to love Eunice like one of my own children.
You cannot guess how quickly she learned the
ways of our home. She soon forgot the old,
wild mountain life and her Indian grandmother‚Äôs
teaching. But just now and then, if
one of us was the least bit cross with her, she
would run away to the woods; and then only
Mollie, whom she always loved best, could bring
her home again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, how I hated to have her leave us!‚Äù Mollie
declared. ‚ÄúBut after the one winter with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
mother, Eunice‚Äôs rich uncle, Mr. Latham, came
here to see her. He was so charmed with her
beauty and shy lovely manners that he took her
back to his home in the Berkshires to spend the
summer with him. This fall Mr. Latham is going
to put Eunice in a girl‚Äôs boarding school in
Boston, so that she can be nearer his place at
Lenox. He wants to be able to see her oftener.
The dream of little Eunice‚Äôs life is to some day
ask ‚ÄòThe Automobile Girls‚Äô to visit her.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, girls,‚Äù said Ruth, as they moved toward
the front porch, leaving their three elders
to chat in the parlor, ‚ÄúI suppose you know I‚Äôve
got something in my mind again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, honor bright, we don‚Äôt,‚Äù declared Barbara.
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt Europe about as much as you can
support at one time?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut Europe doesn‚Äôt happen until next
month, children, and after finishing his business
in the East, papa is going to be kept very busy
for at least a month in the West. In the meantime
Aunt Sallie and I have no place to go but
out, and nothing to do but play around until it‚Äôs
time to sail. And so, honored friends, I‚Äôm
again thrown upon your company for as long a
time as you can endure my presence. And this
is the plan that‚Äôs been working in my head all
the way on the train: What do you say to a
lovely motor trip up along the Hudson to Sleepy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
Hollow? Don‚Äôt you think it would be fine?
Grace can go, and we‚Äôll have our same old happy
crowd. It‚Äôs really only one day‚Äôs trip to Tarrytown,
where we will stop for as long as we like,
and from there we can motor about the country
and see some of the fine estates. It is a
historic place, you know, girls, full of romance
and old stories and legends. We can even motor
up into the hills if we like.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt would be too perfect!‚Äù cried the other two
girls.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just in the mood for adventures, anyway,‚Äù
declared Barbara. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been feeling it
coming over me for a week.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhen are we going?‚Äù asked Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, why not to-morrow,‚Äù replied Ruth,
‚Äúwhile the spirit moves us?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúO joy, O bliss, O rapture unconfined!‚Äù
sang Mollie, dancing up and down the porch in
her delight.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou see, there is no special getting ready to
do,‚Äù went on Ruth. ‚ÄúThe chauffeur will go
over ‚ÄòMr. A. Bubble,‚Äô this afternoon, and put
him in good shape. He‚Äôs been acting excellently
well for such a hardworking old party. I mean
‚ÄòA. Bubble,‚Äô of course.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDoes mother know yet, Ruth?‚Äù asked Barbara,
with a sudden misgiving.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes, she knows all about it. Papa and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
I laid the whole plan before her when we picked
her up in the village. She was agreeable to
everything, but of course she would be. She is
such a dear! Aunt Sallie was the only one who
was a bit backward about coming forward.
She seemed to think that the forest fires would
devour us if we dared venture outside of New
York. But, of course, they are only in the
mountains and there is no danger from them.
It took me an age to gain her consent. If she
has any more time to think about it she may
back out at the eleventh hour.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs it all settled, girls?‚Äù called Mr. Stuart‚Äôs
voice through the open window.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù chorused three gay voices at once.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, I think we‚Äôd better be going up to the
hotel, then,‚Äù cried Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm to be
suffocated by smoke and cinders I think I shall
need all the rest I can get beforehand.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, dearest Aunt Sallie,‚Äù said Ruth, patting
her aunt‚Äôs peach-blossom cheek, ‚Äúthe fires
are nowhere near Sleepy Hollow. They are
miles off in the mountains. And truly, in your
heart, I believe you like these little auto jaunts
better than any of us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNot at all,‚Äù replied the inflexible Miss Stuart.
‚ÄúI am much too old and rheumatic for
such nonsense.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Whereupon she jumped nimbly into the car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
The others all laughed. They understood
Miss Sallie pretty well by this time. ‚ÄúShe has
a stern exterior, but a very melting interior,‚Äù
Barbara used to say of her.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fail to be ready by ten, girls,‚Äù called
Ruth as she followed her aunt, while Mr. Stuart
was offering his adieux to Mrs. Thurston.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, Bab,‚Äù whispered Mollie, as the automobile
disappeared around a curve in the road,
‚Äúwhat about the forest fires?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSh-h!‚Äù said Barbara, with, a finger on her
lip.
</p>
<p>
And they followed their mother into the house.
</p>
<h2><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II‚ÄîMR. STUART CONFIDES A SECRET</h2>
<p>
The next day was like the day before, very
hot and still, the air thick with a smoke-like
mist even in that seashore place. It
hung over the sea like a heavy fog, and the foghorn
could be heard in the distance moaning
like a distracted animal calling for its young.
</p>
<p>
Barbara had refreshed herself by an early
morning dip in the ocean, but she felt the oppressive
atmosphere in spite of the tingling the
cool salt water had given to her skin.
</p>
<p>
They were seated around the little breakfast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
table, always so daintily set, for Mrs. Thurston
had never lost that quality which had characterized
her in her youth and which still clung
to her in the days of her hardships and troubles.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd now, girlies,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou must
promise me one thing. Don‚Äôt lose your heads
at the wrong time. Not that you ever have before,
and I am sure I have no premonitions,
now; but remember, my daughters, if anything
exciting should happen, to make a little prayer
to yourselves; then think hard and the answer
is apt to come before you know it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you remember how Gladys Le Baron
shrieked the time the curtains in her room
caught fire?‚Äù asked Mollie. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt do
anything but just wring her hands and scream,
and it was really Barbara who put the fire out.
Bab pulled down the curtains and threw a
blanket over them. And then Gladys had hysterics.
But Barbara always keeps her head,‚Äù
added Mollie, proudly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYour head is all right, too, Molliekins,‚Äù exclaimed
Barbara. ‚ÄúThe night the man tried to
break in the house, don‚Äôt you remember, mummie,
how brave she was? She followed us up
with a poker as bold as a lion.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo you did, my pet, and I‚Äôm not the least
afraid that either one of you ever will be
lacking in courage. But, when I was very small,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
my mother once taught me a little prayer which
she made me promise to say to myself whenever
I felt the temptation to give way to fear or
anger. And many and many a time it has
helped me. It was only a few words: ‚ÄòHeaven,
make me calm in the face of danger,‚Äô but I have
never known it to fail.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDearest little mother,‚Äù cried Barbara, kissing
her mother‚Äôs soft cheek, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the best
and sweetest little mummie in the world and
I‚Äôm sure I can‚Äôt remember ever having seen you
angry or hysterical or any of those terrible
things. But if ever I do get in a tight place I
hope I shall not forget the little prayer.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚Äú‚ÄòHeaven, make me calm in the face of danger,‚Äô‚Äù
repeated Mollie, softly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, dear me, how gruesome we are!‚Äù exclaimed
Mrs. Thurston. ‚ÄúIt is time you were
packing your bags, at any rate, children. Be
sure and put in your sweaters. You may need
them in spite of this hot wave. And, Mollie,
don‚Äôt forget the cold cream for your little sunburned
nose.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The two girls ran upstairs to their room. In
a few moments they were deep in preparations.
By the time the whir of an automobile was heard
in the distance they had got into their fresh
linen suits and broad-brimmed straw hats, and
were waiting on the porch with suit cases and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
small satchels. Mrs. Thurston looked them
over with secret pride.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you see anything lacking, mother?‚Äù
asked Barbara.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, Bab, my dear. I haven‚Äôt a word to say.
You made a very choice selection in that pink
linen, and Mollie was just as happy in her blue
one. I never saw neater looking dresses. I
hope they won‚Äôt wrinkle much. But you can
have them pressed at the hotel, I suppose.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our automobile coats,‚Äù exclaimed
Mollie proudly, as she shook out her
long pongee duster, last year‚Äôs Christmas gift
from Ruth. ‚ÄúThis is the first time we‚Äôve had
a chance to wear them. I feel so grand in
mine!‚Äù she continued, as she slipped it on.
‚ÄúWith all this veil and hat I can almost imagine
I am a millionaire.‚Äù And she swept up the
porch and back with a society air that was perfect.
‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she said to her mother
in a high, affected voice. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you take a
little spin with me in my car? Life is such a
bore now at these barbarous seaside places!
There is really nothing but bridge and motoring,
and one can‚Äôt play bridge all the time. Oh,
and by the way,‚Äù she continued, pretending to
look at Bab haughtily, through a lorgnette,
‚Äúwon‚Äôt you bring your little girl along? She
can sit with the chauffeur.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
They were still laughing when the automobile
came spinning up with Ruth, Grace Carter, Miss
Sallie Stuart and her brother.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOn time, as usual, girls,‚Äù cried Ruth gayly.
‚ÄúAnd I am late as usual. But who cares? It‚Äôs
a lovely day and we‚Äôre going to have a perfect
time. I am so glad we‚Äôre going that I would
like to execute a few steps on your front porch
for joy.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù said Barbara. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just
been having one exhibition from Miss Clare
Vere de Vere Thurston, who is bursting with
pride over her automobile coat, and we would
be pleased to see another.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBy the way, I should like to have a few
words in private with the young party in the
pink dress,‚Äù called Mr. Stuart, who was engaged
in taking a last look at the inner workings
of the automobile.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMeaning me?‚Äù asked Bab. ‚ÄúCome in,
won‚Äôt you, Mr. Stuart?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, what could they be having secrets
about?‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, and even Miss Sallie
looked somewhat mystified.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am dying to know what you two are confabbing
about,‚Äù cried Ruth, as Mr. Stuart and
Barbara returned. ‚ÄúHave you given Bab permission
to tell us?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMiss Barbara Thurston is a young woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
of such excellent judgment,‚Äù replied Mr. Stuart,
‚Äúthat I shall leave the secret entirely in her
hands, and rely upon her to keep it or tell it as
she thinks best.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a nice
mystery to commence the day on! But come
along, girls; we had better be starting.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stuart, with Bab‚Äôs assistance, gathered
up the bags and suit cases piled on the porch,
packing the cases on the back with the others
where they were secured with straps, and putting
the small hand satchels on the floor of the
car. Barbara seized her own satchel rather
hastily and placed it beside her on the seat.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Bab, one would think you were a
smuggler,‚Äù cried Ruth. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to
put your satchel on the floor with the others?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, never mind,‚Äù replied Barbara carelessly.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right here,‚Äù and she exchanged
a meaning look with Mr. Stuart.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear me!‚Äù exclaimed Ruth. ‚ÄúYou and
papa grow ‚Äòcuriouser and curiouser.‚Äô‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Then the good-byes were said, and the big
automobile went skimming down the road in a
whirl of dust, leaving Mrs. Thurston and Mr.
Stuart at the gate waving their handkerchiefs,
until it turned the curve and was lost to
sight.
</p>
<p>
The travelers lunched at Allaire, as usual, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
the little open-air French restaurant, and strolled
about under the enormous elms of the deserted
village while the meal was being prepared. But
they did not linger after lunch. Ruth was hoping
to make Tarrytown in time for dinner that
evening, instead of stopping for the night in
New York, which, she said, appeared to be suffering
from the heat like a human being. ‚ÄúThe
poor, tired city is all fagged out and fairly panting
from the humidity. If all goes well, I think
we should get to New York by four o‚Äôclock, have
tea at the Waldorf and start for Tarrytown at
five. We ought to reach there by seven at the
latest. It will be a long ride, but it‚Äôs lots cooler
riding than it is sitting still. Once we get to
Tarrytown we can linger as long as we please.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They whizzed along the now familiar road,
through the endless chain of summer resorts
that line the Jersey coast, up the Rumson Road
between the homes of millionaires, and finally
struck the road to New York.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be easy sailing now,‚Äù observed Ruth,
‚Äúif we only catch the ferries.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
By a stroke of good luck they were able to do
so, and actually drew up in front of the Waldorf
at a few minutes before four o‚Äôclock.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, Ruth, I must say you are a pretty
good calculator,‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie,
‚Äúharum-scarum that you are.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a brief interval for face-washing
and the smoothing of flattened pompadours;
another longer one for consuming lettuce sandwiches
and tea, followed by ices and cakes, and
the party was off again, as swiftly as if it had
been carrying secret government dispatches.
</p>
<p>
Up Riverside Drive they sped, past the Palisades
which loomed purple and amethyst in the
misty light. Then eastward to Broadway,
which was once the old Albany Post Road;
along the borders of Van Courtlandt Park,
where, even on that hot day, the golfers were
out; through Yonkers, too citified to be interesting
to the girls just then; and, finally, along the
river through the loveliest country Barbara and
Mollie had ever seen. Still the crags of the
Palisades towered on one side, while on the other
were beautiful estates stretching back into the
hills, and little villages nestling down on the
river front.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie and Grace were both sound asleep
on the back seat. Mollie had let down one of the
small middle seats, and sat resting her chin on
the back of the seat in front of her, occasionally
pressing her sister‚Äôs shoulder for sympathy.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was in a brown study. She was very
tired. It was no joke playing chauffeur for
more than a hundred miles in one day.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab,‚Äù whispered Mollie, awed by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
lovely vistas of river and valley, ‚Äúdo you think
the Vale of Cashmere could be more exquisite
than this? Or the Rhine, or Lake Como, or any
other wonderful place we have never seen?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it marvelous, little sister? It‚Äôs like an
enchanted country, and it is full of legends and
history, too. During the Revolution the two
armies were encamped all through here.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù interrupted Ruth. ‚ÄúIf I were
not too tired, I might tell you a lot of things
about this historical spot, but we must take
another spin down here later and see it all again.
This village we are now entering is Irvington,
the home of Washington Irving. His house is
no longer open to the public, however. Tarrytown
is only a little distance down the river.
We shall soon be there.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
It was not long before a tired, sleepy party
of automobilists drew up in front of an old hotel
shaded with immense elms.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWake up, Aunt Sallie, dear,‚Äù cried Ruth,
giving her sleeping relative a gentle shake.
‚ÄúBestir yourselves, sweet ladies, for food and
rest are at hand and the hostelry is open to us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Supper was, indeed, ready, and rooms, too.
For Mr. Stuart had notified the hotel proprietor
to expect an automobile containing five women
to descend upon him about sundown.
</p>
<p>
The five travelers mounted the steps to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
supper room, and refreshed themselves with
beefsteak and hot biscuits; then mounted more
steps to their bedrooms, where they soon fell
into five untroubled slumbers.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III‚ÄîROCKING CHAIR ADVENTURES</h2>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, girls,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, next
morning at the breakfast table,
‚Äúhere we are ready for adventures.
But they will have to be early morning or late
evening ones. It‚Äôs already too hot to breathe.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFor my part,‚Äù observed Miss Sallie, ‚Äúthe
only adventure I am seeking is to sit on the
shady side of the piazza, in a wicker chair, and
read the morning paper.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, Miss Sallie, even that might turn into
something,‚Äù said romantic Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, indeed,‚Äù pursued Ruth, ‚Äúyou know the
way mamma met papa was by staying at home
instead of going to a ball.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Ruth!‚Äù cried Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs quite true, dear Aunt Sallie.
Mamma was visiting at a house party in the
South, somewhere, and she had a headache and
stayed home from a ball, and was sitting in the
library. Papa came a-calling on one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
others, and was ushered into the library, by
mistake, and introduced himself to mamma‚Äîand
she forgot her headache and he forgot he
was due to catch a train to New York at nine
o‚Äôclock. It was simply a case of love at first
sight.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dear, I am not looking for any such romantic
adventures,‚Äù said Miss Sallie, bridling.
‚ÄúYour father was an intimate friend of the
family at whose house your mother was stopping.
It was perfectly natural they should
have met, if not that evening, at least another
one. I always said your mother showed extreme
good sense in staying away from a party
and nursing her headache. Not many others
would have done the same.‚Äù Miss Stuart gave
her niece a meaning look, while the four girls
suppressed their smiles and exchanged telegraphic
glances of amusement.
</p>
<p>
Not long before Ruth had ‚Äúdoctored‚Äù herself
up with headache medicine, and had gone
to a dance against her aunt‚Äôs advice. As a result
she had been obliged to leave before the
evening was over, more on account of the medicine
than the headache, Miss Sallie had believed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDearest little auntie, you have a touch of
sun this morning, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù asked Ruth,
leaning over and patting her aunt‚Äôs soft cheek;
while Miss Stuart, who was indeed feeling the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
general oppressiveness of the weather, melted
at once into a good humor and smiled at her
niece tenderly.
</p>
<p>
Two persons were rather curiously watching
this little scene from behind the shelter of the
morning papers. One of them, a very handsome
elderly man, seated at a table by the window,
had started perceptibly when the party entered
the room; and from that moment, he had
hardly eaten a bite of breakfast. He was occupied
in examining not the fair young girls but
Miss Sallie herself, who was entirely unconscious
of being the object of such scouting.
</p>
<p>
The other individual was quite different in
appearance. He was dressed in black leather
from head to foot, and a motor cap and glasses
lay beside him on the table. His evident interest
in the conversation of the girls was impersonal,
perhaps the curiosity of a foreigner in a
strange country. There was some admiration
in his eyes as they rested on pretty Mollie‚Äôs
golden curls and fresh smiling face; but his
manner was perfectly respectful and he was
careful to conceal his glances by the newspaper.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat man is rather good-looking in a foreign
sort of way,‚Äù whispered Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúToo much blacky face and shiny eye, to suit
my taste,‚Äù replied Bab. ‚ÄúHe looks like a pirate,
or a smuggler, in that black leather suit.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear me, you are severe, Bab,‚Äù observed
Ruth. ‚ÄúIf he were not so young, I should take
him for an opera singer on a vacation. He
would do nicely dressed as a cavalier.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBe careful, my dears; you are talking much
too loudly,‚Äù admonished Miss Sallie, for the
young foreigner had evidently overheard the
conversation, and had turned his face away to
conceal an expression of amusement.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI vote we adjourn to the porch,‚Äù said Ruth,
‚Äúuntil we decide where we are going this morning.
Come on, auntie, dear. There may be a
rocking chair adventure waiting for you on that
shady piazza. I saw a white haired gentleman
giving you many glances of admiration, this
morning, around the corner of his newspaper.
Did you notice it, girls?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI did,‚Äù replied Grace, somewhat hesitatingly,
for she was just a little fearful about entering
into these teasing humors with Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly, Ruth,‚Äù said Miss Sallie.
But she glanced quickly over her shoulder,
nevertheless, as she led the little procession from
the dining room, her lavender muslin draperies
floating in the breeze. She stopped in the office
and bought a newspaper, then proceeded to the
shady piazza, where she seated herself in a rocking
chair and unfolded the paper.
</p>
<p>
The girls leaned over the railing and looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
down into the street, while Ruth expounded her
views on their morning‚Äôs ride.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSuppose we have a lunch fixed up,‚Äù she was
saying, ‚Äúand spend the morning at Sleepy
Hollow? It‚Äôs lovelier than anything you ever
imagined, just what Washington Irving says of
it, a place to dream in and see visions.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
A charming tenor voice floated out from an
upper window, singing a song in some foreign
language.
</p>
<p>
The girls looked at each other and laughed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe did hear us, and he is an opera singer,‚Äù
whispered Grace.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù came Miss Sallie‚Äôs voice from
the depths of the paper.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúKnew what?‚Äù demanded the four girls
somewhat guiltily, as the singing continued.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúKnew that we would all be cremated if we
came into these dreadful wild regions,‚Äù replied
Miss Sallie, as she gazed tragically down the
shaded street lined with beautiful old homes.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, Miss Sallie,‚Äù interposed Barbara in
soothing tones, ‚Äúthe fires are up in the Catskills
and the Adirondacks, aren‚Äôt they? It is
only when the wind blows in this direction that
we get the smoke from them. Even New York
gets it, then; and certainly there is no danger
of New York burning up from the forest fires.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery well, my dears, if we do run into one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
of those shocking conflagrations, you may just
recall my words to you this morning.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls all laughed, and there is nothing
prettier than the sound of the light-hearted
laughter of young girls; at least so thought the
tall, military-looking man they had seen at
breakfast. He had strolled out on the piazza,
and was walking straight toward Miss Sallie
with an air of determination that was unmistakable
even to the stately lady in lavender.
</p>
<p>
A few feet from her chair he paused as if a
sudden thought had arrested him, and the two
looked straight into each other‚Äôs faces for the
space of half a minute. The girls were fairly
dumb with amazement as they watched the little
drama. Miss Sallie‚Äôs face had flushed and
paled before it resumed its natural peachy tone.
They could not see the face of the stranger
whose back was turned to them.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs it possible,‚Äù asked Miss Sallie after a moment,
in a strange voice, ‚Äúthat this is John Ten
Eyck?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
She had risen from her chair, in her excitement,
and the newspapers had fallen on the floor
with her lavender silk reticule, her fan and
smelling salts, her lace-edged handkerchief and
spectacle case, all in a confused mass.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou have not forgotten me, Sallie?‚Äù the
man demanded, almost dramatically. ‚ÄúI am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
John Ten Eyck, grown old and gray. I never
dreamed that any of my old friends would recognize
me after all these years. But are these
your girls, Sallie?‚Äù he asked, turning with a
courtly air to the four young women.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, indeed, John,‚Äù replied Miss Sallie,
rather stiffly, ‚ÄúI have never married. This is
my niece, Ruth Stuart, my only brother‚Äôs
child.‚Äù And she proceeded to introduce the
others in turn. ‚ÄúRuth, my child, this is Major
John Ten Eyck, an old friend of mine, whom
I have not seen for many years. I suppose you
have lived in foreign lands for so long you have
completely lost sight of your American friends.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt has been a great many years,‚Äù answered
Major Ten Eyck, after he had taken each girl
by the hand and had looked into her face with
such gentleness and charm of manner as to win
them all completely. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been thirty years,
has it not, Sallie?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me such a question, John Ten
Eyck! I‚Äôm sure I have no desire to be reminded
of how old we are growing. Do you
know, you are actually getting fat and bald;
and here I am with hair as white as snow.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut your face is as young as ever, Sallie,‚Äù
declared the gallant major.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it, Major Ten Eyck?‚Äù exclaimed Ruth,
who had found her voice at last. ‚ÄúShe is just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
as pretty as she was thirty years ago, I am
certain. Papa says she is, at any rate.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo she is, my dear,‚Äù agreed the old man as
he gazed with undisguised admiration into Miss
Sallie‚Äôs smiling face.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo sit down,‚Äù said Miss Sallie, slightly confused,
‚Äúand tell us where you have been, and
what you have been doing these last three decades.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt would take too long, I fear,‚Äù replied the
major, looking at his watch. ‚ÄúI am looking for
my two nephews this morning.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou mean Martin‚Äôs sons, I suppose?‚Äù asked
Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, they are coming down to stay with me
at my old place, back yonder in the hills. They
are bringing one or two friends with them, and
we shall motor over this afternoon if the
weather permits. But tell me, what are you
doing here? Spending the summer? Don‚Äôt
you find it a little dull, young ladies?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, we are just on a motor trip, too,‚Äù replied
Ruth. ‚ÄúWe are birds of passage, and stop
only as long as it pleases us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd have you no men along, to look after
you and protect you from highwaymen, or mend
the tires when they are punctured?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dear Major,‚Äù replied Miss Sallie, ‚Äúyou
have been away from America for so long that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
you are old-fashioned. Do you think these athletic
young women need a man to protect them?
I assure you that the world has been changing
while you have been burying yourself in Russia
and Japan. Ruth, here, is as good a
chauffeur as could be found, and Barbara
Thurston can protect herself and us into the
bargain. She rides horseback like a man.‚Äù
Barbara blushed at the memory of the stolen
horseback ride on the way to Newport. ‚ÄúGrace
and Mollie are a little bit more old-fashioned,
perhaps, and I am as helpless as ever. But two
are quite enough. They have got us out of
every scrape so far, the two of them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls all laughed.
</p>
<p>
Only Barbara, who was leaning on the railing
facing the window, saw a figure move behind
the curtain, which had stood so still she had not
noticed it before.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSince you are off on a sort of wild goose
chase for amusement,‚Äù began the major (here
the figure that was slipping away paused again),
‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt you confer a great honor and pleasure
on an old man by making him a visit?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh!‚Äù cried the girls, breathless with delight,
remembering the automobile full of youths that
would shortly appear.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, Miss Sallie, you see they all want to
come,‚Äù continued the major. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt, I beg of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
you, destroy their pleasure and my happiness
by declining this request of my old age.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, do say yes, Aunt Sallie!‚Äù cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
And still Miss Sallie hesitated. She had a
curious smile on her face as she looked out over
the hills and meadows beyond.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting old place, Sallie,‚Äù continued
the major. ‚ÄúIt was built by my Dutch
ancestors, a charming old house that has
been added to from time to time. I would
like to see it full of young faces once more.
What do you say, Sallie? Won‚Äôt you make us
all happy? The boys and me, and the girls, too?
For I can see by their faces they are eager to
come.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow far is it from here, John,‚Äù asked Miss
Sallie, doubtfully. ‚ÄúIs it anywhere near those
dreadful forest fires?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is fifteen miles back in the country, and
I have heard no rumor of any fires in that vicinity
lately. The boys and I are leaving this
afternoon. We will see that everything is ship-shape,
and you and the girls could follow to-morrow.
I have an excellent housekeeper. She
and her husband were a young couple when I
went away, and they have lived at the place ever
since. I am certain she can make you comfortable.
I will give Miss Ruth explicit directions
about the route. It is a fairly good road for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
motoring. We have a fine place for dancing
there, young ladies. There‚Äôs a famous floor in
what, in my grandmother‚Äôs time, we used to call
the red drawing-room. There are dozens of
places for picnics, pretty valleys and creeks that
I explored and knew intimately in my youth. I
have some good horses in my stables, Miss Barbara,
if you have a fancy for riding,‚Äù he continued,
turning to Barbara with such grace of
manner that she blushed for pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Looking from one eager face to another, and
finally into the major‚Äôs kindly gray eyes, Miss
Sallie melted into acquiescence and the party
was made up forthwith.
</p>
<p>
The major then pointed out to Ruth and Barbara
the street they were to take, which would
lead to the road to his old home. He drew a
map on a piece of paper, so that they could make
no mistake.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhen you come to the crossroads,‚Äù he
added, as a parting caution, ‚Äútake the one with
the bridge, which you can see beyond. The
other road is roundabout and full of ruts besides.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Just then the horn of an automobile was
heard, as a large touring car containing four
young men and a deal of baggage, drew up in
front of the hotel. At the same time, Barbara,
who was still facing the window, saw the figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
on the other side of the curtain steal quietly
away.
</p>
<p>
Major Ten Eyck went forward to meet the
newcomers, and he and his two nephews had a
little earnest conversation together for a few
moments. The young men looked up, saw Miss
Sallie and the girls, and all four caps came off
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt go yet,‚Äù called the major, as
Miss Stuart rose to leave. ‚ÄúI want to introduce
the boys first.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Stephen and Martin Ten Eyck were handsome,
sturdy youths, with clear cut features.
The two visitors were far different in type; one,
Alfred Marsdale, a young English friend, who
was spending the summer with the Ten Eycks,
and the other, Jimmie Butler, who seemed to
have come from nowhere in particular but to
have been everywhere.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd now come along, boys,‚Äù urged the
major, after he had given the young people a
chance to talk a few minutes. ‚ÄúThese ladies
want their ride, I know, and we must be off for
the hall before it gets too hot for endurance.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
With a last caution to Ruth about the proper
road to Ten Eyck Hall, and a reminder to Miss
Stuart not to break her promise, the major
ushered his boys into the hotel office, while ‚ÄúThe
Automobile Girls‚Äù went up to their rooms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this perfectly jolly, girls?‚Äù called
Ruth from the mirror as she pinned on her hat.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDe-lighted!‚Äù exclaimed Barbara and Mollie,
joining the others.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd listen, girlies, dear! Did you scent a
romance?‚Äù whispered Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt certainly looked very much like one,‚Äù replied
Barbara.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThey were engaged once,‚Äù continued Ruth,
‚Äúbut they had some sort of lovers‚Äô quarrel.
The poor major tried to make it up, but Aunt
Sallie wouldn‚Äôt forgive him, and he went away
and never came back, except for flying trips on
business. Until to-day she has never seen or
heard from him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut she must have cared some, because she
didn‚Äôt marry anyone else,‚Äù observed Mollie reflectively.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI wonder what he did,‚Äù pondered Grace.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFlirted with another girl,‚Äù answered Ruth.
‚ÄúPapa has often told me about it. Aunt Sallie
had another lover, at the same time, who was
very rich. She kept the two of them dangling
on, and it was because she went driving with the
other lover that Major Ten Eyck paid devoted
attention to some other girl, one night at a ball.
So they quarreled and separated.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPoor old major!‚Äù sighed tender-hearted
Mollie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut she <em>did</em> have her rocking chair adventure
after all,‚Äù laughed Barbara, as they started
downstairs in obedience to Miss Sallie‚Äôs tap a
few moments before.
</p>
<p>
The lovely vistas of valley and river, with intersecting
hills, were softened into dream pictures
by a transparent curtain of mist, which
hid the parched look of the foliage from the
long drought.
</p>
<p>
The five automobilists sped along over
smooth roads between splendid estates. Most
of the great houses were screened by stretches
of thickly wooded parks, and each park was
guarded by a lodge, after the English fashion.
But there were plenty of charming old houses
in full view of the passerby‚Äîrambling, comfortable
homes set down on smooth lawns.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow beautiful all this is!‚Äù sighed Mollie, as
she leaned back in her seat and gazed down the
long avenue of trees.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù called Ruth over her shoulder. ‚ÄúI
took the longest way to the church, because this
road is so pretty.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the lane to Sleepy Hollow,‚Äù cried
the ever-watchful Barbara, and the automobile
turned into a country road that appeared to
lead off into low-lying hills beyond.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat is that cloud of dust behind us,‚Äù demanded
Miss Sallie, looking back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a man on a motor cycle,‚Äù replied
Grace. ‚ÄúHe is turning in here, too, but he is
slowing up. I suppose he doesn‚Äôt want to give
us a dusting. Rather nice of him, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFancy a motor cycle and a headless horseman
riding in the same lane,‚Äù observed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, if it came to a race,‚Äù replied Barbara,
‚ÄúI think I would take the motor cycle. They
do go like the wind.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the noise of them is so terrifying,‚Äù
went on Ruth, ‚Äúthat the poor headless horseman
would probably have been scared back to
death again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Presently the girls came to a steep declivity in
the land that seemed to dip and rise with equal
suddenness.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs this the Hollow?‚Äù asked Mollie a little
awed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis land is full of hollows, my dear,‚Äù answered
Miss Sallie, who did not like uneven
traveling. ‚ÄúWe have been through several already,
and, with that hobgoblin on an infernal
machine coming after us, and all these dense
forests packing us in on every side, and nothing
but a lonesome churchyard in front of us, it
seems to me we should have brought along some
better protectors than two slips of girls.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Here Miss Sallie paused in order to regain
breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI declare,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know
which one of these roads leads to the churchyard.
Of course we can explore both of them,
but we don‚Äôt want to miss seeing the old church,
and we certainly don‚Äôt want to miss lunch. It
will be so cheerful picnicking in a graveyard.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The automobile stopped and the motor cycle,
catching up with them just then, stopped also.
The rider put his foot down to steady himself,
and removing his black leather cap and glasses,
bowed courteously to Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs Madame looking for the ancient church?‚Äù
he asked, in very excellent English with just a
touch of accent.
</p>
<p>
The five women remembered, at once, that
this was the stranger whom they had lately seen
at breakfast. From closer quarters they saw
that he was good-looking, not with the kind of
looks they were accustomed to admire, but still
undeniably handsome. His features had rather
a haughty turn to them, and his black eyes had
a melancholy look; but even the heavy leather
suit he wore could not hide the graceful slenderness
of his figure.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes; we were looking for the church,‚Äù replied
Miss Sallie in a somewhat mollified tone,
considering she had just called him a hobgoblin
on an infernal machine. ‚ÄúWill you be good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
enough to tell us which one of these roads we
must take?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf you will follow me,‚Äù answered the
stranger, ‚ÄúI also am going there. You will
pardon me if I go in front? If you will wait
a moment I will get somewhat ahead, so that
madame and the other ladies will not be dusted.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI must say he is rather a polite young man,‚Äù
admitted Miss Sallie, ‚Äúif he is somewhat rapid
in his movements.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe is curiously good-looking,‚Äù reflected
Ruth. ‚ÄúNot exactly our kind, I should say;
but, after all, he may be just foreign and different.
Just because he is not an American type
doesn‚Äôt keep him from being nice.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
All the time the foliage was getting more impenetrable.
Tall trees reared themselves on
either side of the road, seeming vanguards of
the forests behind them. A cool, woodsy breeze
touched their cheeks softly, and Barbara closed
her eyes for a moment that she might feel the
enchantment of the place.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow many Dutch burghers and their wives
must have driven up this same grassy road,‚Äù
she was thinking to herself. ‚ÄúHow many
wedding parties and funeral trains, too, for here
is their graveyard. No wonder a traveler
imagined he saw ghosts on this lonely road, with
nothing but a cemetery and an old church to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
cheer him on his way. And here is our auto
running in the very same ruts their funny old
carriages and rockaways must have made, and
this stranger in front of us on something queerer
still. I wonder if ghosts of the future will ride
in phantom autos or on motor cycles. What a
fearful sight! A headless man on an infernal
machine‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Her reflections were interrupted by the turning
around of the automobile. Ruth had evidently
decided to go back by the way they had
come. Opening her eyes she saw before her a
quaint and charming old church set in the midst
of a rambling graveyard.
</p>
<p>
There also stood the black cyclist, like a gruesome
sentinel among the tombs. He lifted his
cap as they drew up, and, after hesitating a moment,
came forward to open the door and help
Miss Sallie alight.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPermit me, Madam,‚Äù he said, with such
grace of demeanor that the lady thanked him
almost with effusion. Grace and Mollie were
assisted as if they had been princesses of
the blood, as they described it later, while the
other two girls leaped to the ground before he
had time to make any overtures in their direction.
</p>
<p>
There was rather an awkward pause, for a
moment, as the stranger, with uncovered head,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
stood aside to let them pass. The silence was
not broken and Miss Stuart chose to let it remain
so.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOne cannot be too careful,‚Äù she had always
said, ‚Äúof chance acquaintances, especially men.‚Äù
However, she was predisposed in favor of the
cyclist, whose manners were exceptional.
</p>
<p>
The girls were strolling about among the
graves, examining the stones with their quaint
epitaphs, while the stranger leaned against a
tree and lit a cigarette.
</p>
<p>
Miss Stuart, with her lorgnette, was making
a survey of the church.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFrom the account of the supper party at the
Van Tassels‚Äô in Sleepy Hollow,‚Äù said Ruth,
‚Äúthe early Dutch must have just about eaten
themselves to death. Do you remember all the
food there was piled on the table at the famous
quilting party? Every kind of cake known to
man, to begin with; or rather, Washington
Irving began with cakes. Roast fowls and turkeys,
hams and sausages, puddings and pies and
the humming tea-urn in the midst of it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the women had such big appetites
as the men,‚Äù observed Mollie. ‚ÄúAt least
Katrina Van Tassel is described as being very
dainty, and I can‚Äôt imagine a pretty young girl
working straight through such a bill of fare,
and yet looking quite the same ever after.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut remember that they took lots of exercise,‚Äù
put in Barbara, ‚Äúof a kind we know nothing
about. All the Dutch girls were taught to
scrub and polish and clean.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat were we doing when Ruth and
Miss Sallie and Mr. Stuart arrived, Bab, I‚Äôd
like to know?‚Äù interrupted Mollie indignantly.
‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt we rubbing the parlor furniture and
polishing the floor?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù returned Barbara, ‚Äúbut you could put
our entire house down in the parlor of one of
those old Dutch farm houses, and still have
room and to spare.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd think of all the copper kettles they had
to keep polished,‚Äù added Grace.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the spinning they had to do,‚Äù said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the cooking and butter making,‚Äù continued
Bab. ‚ÄúYes, Mistress Mollie, I think
there‚Äôs some excuse for sausages and all the
rest. And I am sure I could have forgiven
Katrina if she ate everything in sight.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAh, well,‚Äù replied Mollie, ‚Äúno doubt she was
fat at thirty!‚Äù
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV‚ÄîA CRY FOR HELP</h2>
<p>
AS they talked the young girls wandered
over the grassy sward of the churchyard
and their voices grew fainter and
fainter to the cyclist and Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
The latter had seated herself on the stump
of an old tree and was busily engaged in re-reading
her mail, at which she had glanced only carelessly
that morning.
</p>
<p>
The air was very still and hot, and the hum
of insects made a drowsy accompaniment to the
songs of the birds. The cyclist had stretched
himself at full length on the grass under an immense
elm tree and was lazily blowing blue rings
of smoke skywards.
</p>
<p>
Presently there broke upon the noonday stillness
a cry for help. It was in a high, girlish
voice‚ÄîMollie‚Äôs in fact‚Äîand it was followed by
others in quick succession.
</p>
<p>
Miss Stuart, scattering her mail on the ground
in her fright, rushed in the direction of the
cries, the cyclist close behind her.
</p>
<p>
On a knoll near the church the sight which met
Miss Sallie‚Äôs eyes almost made her knees give
way. But she had a cool head in danger, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
spite of her lavender draperies and pretended
helplessness.
</p>
<p>
A tramp, who seemed to them all at the moment
as big as a giant, with matted hair and
beard and face swollen from drink, had seized
Ruth and Barbara by the wrists with one of his
enormous hands. A woman equally ragged in
appearance was tugging at the fellow‚Äôs other
hand in an effort to quiet him.
</p>
<p>
As Miss Sallie ran toward the group she
heard Barbara say quietly:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLet go our wrists and we shall be glad to
give you all the money we have with us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI tell you I want more money than that,‚Äù
said the man in a hoarse, terrible voice. ‚ÄúI want
enough money to keep me for the rest of my
days. Do you think I like to sleep on the
ground and eat bread and water? I tell you I
want my rights. Why should you be rich and
me poor? Why should you be dressed in silks
while my wife wears rags?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
As he raved, he jerked his hand away from
the woman, almost throwing her forward in his
violence, and gesticulated wildly.
</p>
<p>
The two girls were both very pale and calm,
but the poor tramp woman was crying bitterly.
</p>
<p>
Barbara‚Äôs lips were moving, but she said
nothing, and only Mollie knew it was her
mother‚Äôs prayer she was repeating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be frightened, young ladies,‚Äù sobbed
the woman, ‚ÄúI will see that no harm comes to
you, even if he kills me.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you call this a free country,‚Äù continued
the tramp, ‚Äúwhen there are thousands of people
like me who have no houses and must beg for
food? I would like to kill all the rich men in
this country and turn their children loose to beg
and steal, as we must do to get a living! Do
you think I would ever have come to this pass if
a rich man had not brought me to it? Do you
think I was always a tramp like this, and my wife
yonder a tramp, too?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
At this point the drunken wretch began to
cry, but he still held the two girls tightly by the
wrists.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI tell you I‚Äôll take a ransom for you and
nothing less. I‚Äôll get out of the world all it‚Äôs
taken from me, and your father will have to do
the paying. Come on!‚Äù he cried in a tone of
command, to his trembling wife.
</p>
<p>
At this critical moment Miss Stuart and the
motor cyclist came running to the scene.
</p>
<p>
There was a look of immense relief on Miss
Sallie‚Äôs face when she saw the courteous
stranger at her heels. She had been about to
speak, but was silent.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, ho!‚Äù cried the tramp, ‚Äúso you‚Äôve got a
protector, have you? Well, come on! I‚Äôll fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
the whole lot of you, women and men, too, and
with one hand, at that!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
He loomed up like a giant beside the small,
slender cyclist, but he was a drunken giant nevertheless
and not prepared for what was about to
happen.
</p>
<p>
However, at first, it appeared to them all that
a little persuasion might be better than force.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf you will let the young ladies go, my good
man,‚Äù said the cyclist, ‚Äúyou will not regret it.
You will be well paid. I would advise you to
take a sensible view of the matter. You cannot
kidnap us all, and it would not take long to
get help. Would you prefer a long term in jail
to a sum of money?‚Äù And the cyclist drew a
leather wallet from his coat pocket.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou think you are mighty smart, young
man,‚Äù sneered the tramp, ‚Äúbut I can kidnap all
of you, and nobody ever be the wiser. Do you
think I‚Äôd let a chance like this go? My pals are
right over there.‚Äù He pointed with his free
hand to the woods back of him.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou will be sorry,‚Äù said the cyclist.
</p>
<p>
With an oath, the tramp put his finger to his
mouth and gave a long, shrill whistle.
</p>
<p>
But in that moment he was off his guard, and
the cyclist leaped upon him like a leopard on a
lion. One swift blow under the jaw and down
tumbled the giant as Goliath fell before David.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
The poor woman, who was crouching in terror
behind a tree, jumped to her feet.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRun!‚Äù she cried in a frightened whisper.
‚ÄúRun for your lives!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The cyclist seized Miss Sallie by the arm.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShe is right. It is better to run. The
others may be coming.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And they did run. Terror seemed to lend
wings to their feet. Even Miss Stuart, assisted
by their rescuer, fled over the grass as swiftly
as her charges.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Barbara reached the automobile
first. In an instant Ruth had cranked up the
machine while Barbara opened the door.
</p>
<p>
Another moment, and they were off down the
road, the black-clad cyclist following. Glancing
back, they saw two other rough-looking men
helping their comrade to rise to his feet. Then
they disappeared in the woods while the woman,
with many anxious backward glances, followed
her companions.
</p>
<p>
Nobody spoke for some time. The girls were
too much terrified by the narrow escape to trust
to their voices. The bravest women will weep
after a danger is past, and all five of these
women were very near the point of tears.
</p>
<p>
Presently the cyclist came up alongside of the
automobile, which had slowed down somewhat
when they reached the main road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI will go ahead and inform the police,‚Äù he
called over his shoulder, ‚Äúbut I fear it will not
be of much use. Men like that will scatter and
hide themselves at the first alarm.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie smiled at him gratefully. Touching
his cap, which was fastened under his chin
with a strap and could not be lifted without
some inconvenience, the stranger shot ahead and
soon disappeared in a cloud of dust.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie was thinking deeply. She wished
that Major Ten Eyck and the boys had not left
the hotel that morning. She felt need of the
strong support of the opposite sex. She felt
also the responsibility of being at the head of
her party of young girls.
</p>
<p>
Should they dare start off again next day into
the wilderness after such an experience? Of
course, as long as they were in the automobile,
going at full speed, nothing could stop them except
a puncture, and punctures on country roads
were not as frequent as they were on city
streets. What would her brother say? Would
he sanction such a trip after this fearful experience?
And still she hesitated.
</p>
<p>
The truth was, Miss Stuart was as eager as the
girls to accept the invitation that had been so
unexpectedly made. She did not wish to revive
the romance of her youth, but she did have an
overweening desire to see the ancestral home of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
her old lover, and to talk with him on the thousand
subjects that spring up when two old
friends come together after many years.
</p>
<p>
It was, therefore, with half-hearted vehemence
that she said to the four rather listless girls:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dears, don‚Äôt you think it would be very
dangerous for us to go over to Major Ten
Eyck‚Äôs, to-morrow, after this fearful attack?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Everybody looked relieved that somebody had
had the courage to say the first word.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear auntie, we‚Äôll leave it entirely to you,‚Äù
replied Ruth. ‚ÄúAlthough, I don‚Äôt believe we
are likely to be kidnapped as long as we keep
the automobile going. The fastest running
tramp in Christendom couldn‚Äôt keep up with us,
even when we‚Äôre going at an ordinary rate.
From what Major Ten Eyck said, the road is
pretty good. We ought to get there in an hour,
since it‚Äôs only fifteen miles from here, and the
last mile or so is on his estate.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The other girls said nothing, it being a matter
for the chaperon to settle.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery well, my dear,‚Äù answered Miss Sallie,
acquiescing so suddenly that the others almost
smiled in spite of the seriousness of their feelings
at the moment. ‚ÄúBut I do feel that we had
a narrow escape this morning. If it had not
been for the young man on the motor cycle I
tremble to think what would have been the consequences.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
And I certainly believe if we are not
going back to New York, the sooner we get into
the society of some male protectors the better
for us. I am sorry that fifteen miles separate
us. I wish those boys had thought to motor
back and get us to-morrow.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, well,‚Äù observed Barbara, ‚Äúfifteen miles
is a mere bagatelle, when you come to think of
it. Why, we shall be there before we know it.‚Äù
</p>
<h2><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V‚ÄîTHE MOTOR CYCLIST</h2>
<p>
By this time the automobile had reached
the hotel. Miss Sallie led the way to the
dining room and they formed rather a
weak-kneed procession, for they were beginning
to experience that all-gone feeling that comes
after a fright.
</p>
<p>
The luncheon hamper full of good things had
been carried back into the hotel, since there had
been neither time nor opportunity for the picnic
party the girls had planned.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think a little food is what we really need,
now,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth. ‚ÄúCheer up, Mollie and
Grace. Bab, smile for the ladies. It‚Äôs all over.
Here we are, safe, and we are going to have a
beautiful time at Major Ten Eyck‚Äôs. Please,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
dear friends, don‚Äôt begin to take this gloomy
view of life. As for the anarchist person who
attacked us in the woods, you may depend upon
it that he and his friends are so frightened they
will be running in an opposite direction from
Tarrytown for another week. As for the foreign
young man who stepped up to the rescue,
he should certainly be thanked.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth had by nature a happy temperament.
She quickly threw off small troubles, and depression
in others made her really unhappy.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was truly a daring deed,‚Äù replied Barbara,
‚Äúand all the more daring considering that
the tramp would have made about two of the
cyclist. But the blow he gave was as swift and
sure as a prize fighter‚Äôs.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDid you notice that the poor woman was
rather pretty?‚Äù commented Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dear child,‚Äù cried Miss Sallie, ‚ÄúI really
believe you would notice people‚Äôs looks on the
way to your own execution. Now, for my part,
I could not see anything. I was almost too
frightened to breathe. I felt that I should faint
at any moment.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Aunt Sallie, you are more frightened
now than you were then,‚Äù exclaimed her
niece. ‚ÄúYou were as calm as the night. As
for Grace, she looked like a scared rabbit. Mollie,
darling, I‚Äôm glad you had the presence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
mind to scream. If you hadn‚Äôt Aunt Sallie and
the motor cyclist might have looked for us in
vain.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
While she was speaking the cyclist came into
the dining-room.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Miss Stuart saw him she rose from
the table in her most stately manner and walked
over to meet him.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSir,‚Äù she said, and Ruth gave the merest
flicker of a blink at Bab, ‚Äúyou did a very brave
thing to-day, and I want to thank you for all
of us. If you had not been there my niece and
her friend would undoubtedly have been kidnapped.
You perhaps saved their lives. They
might have been killed by those ruffians. Won‚Äôt
you give us your name and address? My
brother, I am sure, would like to write to you
himself. We shall be indebted to you always.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The young man‚Äôs face flushed with embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was nothing, I assure you, Madam,‚Äù he
replied. ‚ÄúIt was easy because the man was intoxicated.
He went over at the first blow. My
name,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúis Martinez. Jos√© Martinez.
My address is the Waldorf, New York.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am Miss Stuart,‚Äù said Miss Sallie, ‚Äúand I
would like to present you to my niece, Miss Ruth
Stuart, and her friends Miss Grace Carter and
Misses Barbara and Mollie Thurston. It would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
give us great pleasure if you would lunch with
us, Mr. Martinez.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhen a man saves your life you certainly
can‚Äôt stand on ceremony,‚Äù commented Miss Sallie
to herself.
</p>
<p>
An animated discussion followed. Mr. Martinez
had been to see the chief of police, he said,
who would call on Miss Stuart that afternoon,
if convenient. He could not offer any hope,
however, of catching the men.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie replied that, for her part, she
hoped they wouldn‚Äôt take the creatures. It
would do no good and she did not want to spend
any time cooped up in a court room in such
scorching weather. But did Mr. Martinez think
it would be dangerous for them to take a trip up
into the hills the next day?
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt would depend upon the road,‚Äù replied
Mr. Martinez. ‚ÄúThat is, if the trip were taken
by automobile. Of course my motor cycle can
run on any road.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is a good road,‚Äù replied Ruth. ‚ÄúAt the
crossroads there is a bad road; but, fortunately,
we do not have to take it, since the new road
with the bridge has been opened up, so Major
Ten Eyck says.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In which case Mr. Jos√© Martinez was of a
mind with the young ladies that the trip would
be perfectly safe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie gave a sigh of relief. If this estimable
young man sanctioned the trip she felt
they might take it with clear consciences. But
she did hope her brother‚Äôs views on the subject
would be the same.
</p>
<p>
Then the talk drifted into other channels.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are a Spaniard, I presume, Mr. Martinez?‚Äù
questioned Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, Madam, a Spaniard by birth, a Frenchman
by education and at present an American
by choice. I have lived in England, also, but
I believe I prefer America to all other countries,
even my own.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Miss Stuart was much gratified at this avowal.
She felt that in complimenting America he was
complimenting her indirectly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHave you seen the Alhambra and the Rock
of Gibraltar?‚Äù demanded Mollie, her wide,
blue eyes full of interest.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes, Madamoiselle,‚Äù replied the handsome
Spaniard, smiling at her gently, ‚ÄúI have
seen the Alhambra many times, and Gibraltar
once only.‚Äù A curious shade passed over his
face as if Gibraltar held memories which he was
not anxious to revive.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDoes the Rock of Gibraltar really look like
a lion?‚Äù asked Grace, who had not noticed his
distaste to the mere mention of the name.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI do not know, Madamoiselle,‚Äù he replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
shortly. ‚ÄúI saw it only from land. I was,‚Äù
he added hesitatingly, ‚Äúvery ill when I was
there.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The waiter announced the chief of police to
see Miss Sallie, and the luncheon party adjourned
to the shady side of the piazza.
</p>
<p>
All this time Barbara had been very quiet, so
quiet, indeed, that Ruth had asked her in a whisper,
as they left the dining room, if she were
still feeling the shock of the morning.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, no,‚Äù replied Barbara, ‚ÄúI am simply
trying to stifle a ridiculous fear I have that,
maybe, we ought not to go to-morrow. It is absurd,
so please don‚Äôt mention it to the others,
especially as even Miss Sallie thinks it safe, and
little coward Mollie is not afraid.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are just tired, poor dear,‚Äù said sympathetic
Ruth. ‚ÄúCome along up to your room,
and we shall have a little ‚Äòrelaxation,‚Äô as my old
colored mammy used to say. We‚Äôll spend a
quiet afternoon in our rooms, and at sunset we
can take a spin along the river bank before supper.
What do you say?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am agreeable,‚Äù replied Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGood afternoon, Mr. Martinez,‚Äù said Ruth,
as the others came up. ‚ÄúYou will be wanting
to take your siesta now, I suppose. Siestas, in
Spain, are like afternoon tea in England, aren‚Äôt
they? Here in America we don‚Äôt have either,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
much, but I think we shall need both to-day.
Perhaps we shall see you at dinner?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf I may have that pleasure,‚Äù replied the
Spaniard, bowing low.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStrangers of the morning are friends in the
afternoon, in this, our life of adventure,‚Äù
laughed Ruth as they passed along the corridor
to the steps.
</p>
<p>
But they did not see the stranger again that
day. For some mysterious reason he left the
hotel in the afternoon, and did not return until
nearly midnight, when Barbara, who happened
to be awake, heard him whistling softly as he
went down the hall to his room.
</p>
<h2><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI‚ÄîA FOREST SCRIMMAGE</h2>
<p>
It was really Miss Sallie Stuart‚Äôs fault that
they were so late in starting the next day
to Major Ten Eyck‚Äôs home.
</p>
<p>
The automobile had been ordered to be on
hand immediately after an early luncheon, but
another call from one of the town police caused
the first delay.
</p>
<p>
The tramps had securely hidden themselves,
the officer said, and no trace of them had been
found in other towns in that vicinity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
The second delay was caused by a telegram
from Miss Stuart‚Äôs dressmaker, stating that a
dress had been expressed to her which would
reach Tarrytown that morning. Bab and Mollie
were also expecting an express package
of fresh clothes and their organdie dresses,
which they felt, now, they would assuredly
need.
</p>
<p>
Consequently the party waited patiently for
these ever-necessary feminine adornments, and
it was four o‚Äôclock before the girls started.
</p>
<p>
A third delay was caused by the puncture of a
tire just as they were leaving the hotel. Now
they were obliged to go to the nearest garage
and have it repaired, which consumed another
three quarters of an hour.
</p>
<p>
However, it was pleasanter riding in the cool
of the afternoon, and they still hoped to reach
Ten Eyck Hall long before dark. It was a very
gay party that finally took the road, swathed in
chiffon veils and dusters.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI never felt so much interested in a visit as
I do in this one,‚Äù remarked Ruth. ‚ÄúCertainly
we ought to be glad to get there after all these
mishaps and delays.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Barbara was still in her silent humor. She
sat with her small handbag clasped tightly on
her knees and looked straight before her, as
though she were watching for something.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab, my child, what is it?‚Äù asked Ruth.
‚ÄúYou have been in a brown study all day.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNothing at all, dear,‚Äù replied Bab, smiling.
‚ÄúPerhaps this haziness goes to my head a little.
But I am awfully glad, too, about the visit.
I always wanted to see an old colonial house,
and the only way really is to stay in it. If we
have the run of the rooms, and all the halls and
galleries, we can get to know it much more intimately
than if we were just sight-seers being
conducted through by an aged housekeeper.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, on the back seat, Miss Sallie was
in a reminiscent mood. It was very agreeable
to her to hark back to the joyous days of her
youth, for Miss Stuart had been a belle, and the
two girls were listening with pleasure to her accounts
of the gallant major, who had been graduated
from West Point ahead of time in order to
join the army during the Civil War.
</p>
<p>
The conversation was interrupted by the sudden
stoppage of the automobile at the crossroads,
one of which led straight into the woods,
while the other branched off into the open, crossing
the now dry bed of a river spanning which
was the new bridge.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is the right road, of course,‚Äù said Ruth,
taking the one with the bridge.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait!‚Äù cried Barbara. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something
stretched across the bridge.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, a rope blocked all passage over
the bridge, which was quite a long one. Secured
to the rope with cords was a plank on
which was painted:
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p>‚ÄúDANGEROUS: TAKE THE OTHER ROAD!‚Äù</p>
</div>
<p>
‚ÄúThe paint on the sign is still sticky,‚Äù exclaimed
Barbara who had jumped out and run
over to take a good look at it. ‚ÄúAnd the bridge
is broken. There is a large hole, like a gash,
on one side, and another further down.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow remarkable!‚Äù replied Ruth. ‚ÄúIt must
have happened some time this morning. I do
not suppose Major Ten Eyck knows anything
about it, or he would have let us know. I‚Äôll
back up, anyway, to the crossroads, and we can
decide what to do. We could go on, I suppose.
The major said the other road passed his front
gate, but it was a longer one and not such good
traveling. What do you say, Aunt Sallie?
Speak up, girls, are you all agreed?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie was much troubled. She wanted
to go and she did not want to go, and her mind
was in a turmoil.
</p>
<p>
Bab was silent, and Grace and Mollie looked
ready for anything.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Miss Sallie, after a moment‚Äôs
reflection, ‚Äúit is very dangerous and very venturesome;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
but, having got thus far, let us proceed
on our way.‚Äù She folded her hands resignedly,
like a martyred saint.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThen off we go!‚Äù cried Ruth. The automobile
rolled into the wooded road that penetrated
a deeper part of the forest.
</p>
<p>
The dense shade was a relief after the open,
dusty country. Tall trees interlaced their
branches overhead and the ground was carpeted
with fern and bracken.
</p>
<p>
But an uneasiness had come upon the automobilists.
They did not attempt to explain it, for
there was no apparent cause. The road was excellent
so far, smooth and level; but something
was in the air. Miss Sallie was the first to
break the silence.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am terribly frightened,‚Äù she admitted, in
a low voice. ‚ÄúWe must have been bewitched
to have attempted this ride. Ruth, my dear,
I beg of you to turn and go back. I feel that
we are running into danger.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth slowed up the machine a little, and
called over her shoulder:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are right, Aunt Sallie, but I am afraid
we can‚Äôt turn just yet, because there isn‚Äôt room.
Anyway, we may be nearer to the other end of
the wood by this time.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The car sped on again, only to stop with such
a sudden jerk, in the very depths of the forest,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
that the machinery ceased to whir and in a moment
was silent.
</p>
<p>
For a few moments all hands sat perfectly
still, dumb with terror and amazement.
</p>
<p>
Across the road was stretched another rope.
There was no sign board on it to tell them there
was danger ahead, but the girls needed none.
They felt that there was danger ahead, behind,
and all around them. They knew they were in
a trap, and that the danger that threatened them
would make itself known all too soon.
</p>
<p>
Barbara had whispered to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBack up as fast as you can!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth had replied in another whisper:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt before I crank up.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Regaining her nerve, Ruth was about to leap
to the ground when she saw, and the four others
saw at the same moment, the figure of a man
standing by a tree at the roadside. It would
seem that he had been standing there all along,
but so still and motionless that he might
been one of the trees themselves. And for two
reasons he was a terrifying spectacle: one because
his features were entirely concealed by a
black mask, the other because he carried in one
hand a gleaming and remarkably sharp looking
knife, a kind of dagger, the blade slightly curved
and pointed at the end, the silver handle chased
all over in an intricate design.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
To her dying day Bab would never forget the
picture he made.
</p>
<p>
He wore a dark green velveteen suit, like a
huntsman‚Äôs, and a felt hat with a hanging brim
that covered his head.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPardon me, ladies,‚Äù he said in a curious,
false voice, ‚Äúbut I must request you to keep your
places.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth, who was poised just over the step, fell
back beside Barbara, who had maintained her
position, and sat with blanched cheeks and
tightly closed lips.
</p>
<p>
The highwayman then deliberately slashed all
four tires with his murderous looking weapon.
At each explosion Miss Sallie gave a stifled
groan.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo not cry out, Madam,‚Äù said the robber
sternly, ‚Äúor it will go hard with you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBe still,‚Äù whispered little Mollie, bravely
taking Miss Stuart‚Äôs hand and patting it
gently.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd now, ladies,‚Äù continued the man more
politely, ‚ÄúI must ask you to put all your money
and jewelry in a pile here. Stand up,‚Äù he said
to Barbara. ‚ÄúPut it on this seat and leave out
nothing or you will regret it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The five women began mechanically to remove
what simple jewelry they happened to be
wearing, for the most part pins, rings, bracelets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
and watches, the latter Ruth‚Äôs and Grace‚Äôs.
Then came the pocket books, Mollie‚Äôs little blue
silk knitted purse topping the pyramid.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut this is not all your money,‚Äù said the
robber impatiently. ‚ÄúDo not delay. It is getting
late.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have some more in my bag,‚Äù said Ruth
faintly. ‚ÄúMollie, it is on the back seat. Will
you hand it to me?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Mollie searched with trembling hands for the
bag which was stored somewhere under the seat.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd have you nothing in that bag?‚Äù asked
the highwayman, turning roughly to Barbara.
</p>
<p>
She did not answer at first. Her lips were
moving silently and the others thought she must
be praying. Only Mollie knew she was repeating,
for the second time since they had left home,
the words her mother had taught her: ‚ÄúHeaven
make me calm in the face of danger.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The highwayman laid his hand on the bag,
flourishing his knife in a menacing way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù she said calmly, looking at him with
such contempt that his eyes dropped before her.
</p>
<p>
Placing the bag on Ruth‚Äôs lap, Bab slowly
opened it, fumbled inside for a moment and drew
out a small pistol.
</p>
<p>
It caught a last ray of the setting sun, which
had filtered through the trees and gleamed dangerously,
in spite of its miniature size.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
Barbara pointed it deliberately at the robber,
with a steady hand, and said quietly:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDrop that knife and run unless you want
me to shoot you!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The robber stared at her in amazement.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúQuick!‚Äù she said and gave the trigger an
ominous click.
</p>
<p>
The pistol was pointed straight at his midwaist.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDrop the knife,‚Äù repeated Barbara, ‚Äúand
back off.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
He dropped the knife and started backward
down the road.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, run!‚Äù cried Barbara. And the highwayman
turned and walked swiftly until he was
out of sight.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time to be lost,‚Äù cried Barbara.
The other four women sat as if in a trance.
Their deliverance had been so unexpected that
they were still suffering from the shock.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie began to wring her hands in
frantic despair.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls, girls!‚Äù she wept, ‚ÄúI have brought
you to this pass! What shall we do? The man
is sure to come back. We can‚Äôt stay here all
night! Oh mercy! why did I ever consent to
take this dangerous trip? It‚Äôs all my fault!‚Äù

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, Aunt Sallie, dearest! It‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs
fault, and you mustn‚Äôt waste your
strength,‚Äù urged Ruth, trying to comfort her
aunt, whose nerves had had about all they could
endure by now. ‚ÄúWhat do you think we‚Äôd better
do?‚Äù continued Ruth, turning to Barbara,
who, with her pistol was keeping watch at the
back of the automobile.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think we shall have to walk,‚Äù replied Barbara.
‚ÄúThere is no other way, and we must
start at once, before it gets dark. Ruth, you
and Grace help Miss Sallie. Mollie, put all the
valuables on the seat into my bag. There is no
time to divide them now. We had better not
try to carry anything except the small bags.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The little company seemed to feel a kind of
relief in submitting itself to Barbara‚Äôs direction.
Each doing as she was bid, they started
down the wood road, leaving the car with all
their baggage behind them.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie had recovered her composure.
The necessity of moving quickly, had taken her
mind off the situation for the present, and she
walked at as brisk a pace as did the girls.
</p>
<p>
Barbara had directed Mollie to walk a little
in front and to keep a sharp lookout, while Bab
brought up the rear and watched the sides of
the road as vigilantly as a guard in war time,
her pistol cocked, ready to defend and fight for
her friends and sister to her last breath.
</p>
<p>
Presently curiosity got the better of Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab,‚Äù she asked, ‚Äúwhere on earth did you
get that pistol?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúFrom your father,‚Äù answered Bab. ‚ÄúThat
was the secret. Don‚Äôt you remember? But we
must not risk talking now. The quieter we are
the better. Voices carry in these woods.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are quite right, Bab, dear,‚Äù replied
Ruth, under her breath, and not another word
was spoken.
</p>
<p>
Each one was engaged in her own thoughts as
the silent procession moved swiftly on.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie was wondering whether they
would ever see morning alive.
</p>
<p>
Grace, who was very devout, was praying
softly to herself.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, in the innermost depths of her mind,
was secretly enjoying the whole adventure, dangerous
as it was.
</p>
<p>
Mollie was feeling homesick for her mother,
while Bab had no time for any thought than the
one that the highwayman might appear at any
moment, and from any direction. Who knew
but that he had turned and doubled on them,
and would spring at them from the next tree?
</p>
<p>
Presently Mollie, who was a few feet in advance
of the others, paused.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLook!‚Äù she whispered as the others came
up. ‚ÄúI see the light of a fire through the trees.
I hear voices, too.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, through the interlacing branches
of the trees, they could distinctly see the glow
of a large fire.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù exclaimed Bah under her breath.
‚ÄúStand here at the side of the road, where
you will be hidden. Perhaps we may find help
at last.‚Äù Creeping cautiously among the trees
she disappeared in the darkness. It seemed an
age to the others, waiting on the edge of the narrow
woodland road, but it was only a few minutes,
in reality, before Bab was back again.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThey are Gypsies,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI can
tell by their wagons and tents.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGypsies!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie, with a
tragic gesture of both hands. ‚ÄúWe shall all be
murdered as well as robbed!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù protested Mollie. ‚ÄúI have a
friend who is a Gypsy. This may be her tribe.
Suppose I go and see. Let me go. Now, Bab,‚Äù
as her sister touched her with a detaining hand,
‚ÄúI want to do something.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And little Mollie, with set lips and pale cheeks,
her courageous heart throbbing with repressed
excitement, stole off into the dense shadows of
the forest.
</p>
<p>
It seemed another age before the stillness was
broken again by the sound of crackling underbrush,
and Mollie‚Äôs figure was gradually outlined
in the blackness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt tell,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey seemed
to be only men sitting around the fire smoking.
I was afraid to get any nearer for fear one of
them might be the robber. They say Gypsies
can be very kind, but I think it would be better
if we all went together and asked for help, if we
go at all. The men looked very fierce,‚Äù she
added faintly, slipping her hand into her sister‚Äôs
for sympathy.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDearest little sister,‚Äù whispered Bab, kissing
her, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever say again you are a coward.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Then two persons emerged from between
the trees on the other side of the road.
</p>
<p>
The five women held their breath in fear and
suspense as the figures approached, evidently
without having seen these women standing in
the shadow. They were close enough now for
the automobilists to make out that they were two
women, one young and the other old apparently.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, with a cry of joy and relief, Mollie
sprang upon the elder of the two women, threw
her arms about the stranger‚Äôs neck and burst
into uncontrollable sobs.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúO Granny Ann, Granny Ann!‚Äù cried Mollie.
‚ÄúAt the very time we needed your help
most you have come to us. I hoped and prayed
it was your tribe, but I couldn‚Äôt tell. There
were only men.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
The old Gypsy woman patted Mollie‚Äôs cheek
tenderly, while the little girl sobbed out the story
of their evening‚Äôs adventure.
</p>
<p>
The others had been so surprised at Mollie‚Äôs
sudden outburst that they stood silently by without
interrupting the story; but all felt that a light
was beginning to break on what a short time
before had looked like a hopeless situation.
</p>
<p>
Granny Ann, the sixty years of whose life had
been spent in wandering over many countries,
was as unperturbed as if they had met by appointment.
Her companion, a young Gypsy
girl, stood quietly by without speaking a word.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe ladies will be safe with us,‚Äù said the old
Gypsy, taking them all in with a comprehensive
sweep of her small beady eyes; ‚Äúas safe as if
they were in their own homes. I have had
shelter and food from the young lady, and a
Gypsy never forgets a kindness. Come with
me,‚Äù she added, with a commanding gesture, and
led the way to the encampment.
</p>
<p>
The Gypsy girl brought up the rear and the
others trailed along in between, Ruth and Grace
still assisting Miss Sallie over the rough places.
</p>
<p>
When they reached the camp the four Gypsy
men, picturesquely grouped around the fire, rose
to their feet and looked curiously but imperturbably
at the party of women.
</p>
<p>
Granny Ann called a grizzled old man from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
the fireside speaking rapidly in a strange language,
her own Romany tongue, in fact. After
conferring with him a few moments, she turned
to Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy rom,‚Äù she said (which in Gypsy language
means husband), ‚Äúthinks you had better
stay here to-night. It would not be easy to find
the gentleman‚Äôs house on such a dark night, but
we can make you comfortable in one of our tents.
He and the other men will take the horses and
draw the steam carriage down the road until it
is near enough to be guarded‚Äîif one of the
young ladies will show the way. There is no
danger,‚Äù she continued, sternly, as Miss Sallie
began to protest at the idea of one of her girls
going off with all those strange men. ‚ÄúA
Gypsy does not repay a kindness with a blow.
Come,‚Äù she called to the men, ‚Äúthat young lady
will show the way.‚Äù And she pointed at Barbara,
who had slipped the pistol into her belt,
and was talking to Ruth in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie explained to the girls what Granny
Ann had decided was the best course for them to
take, while the four men untethered the four lean
horses and half-harnessed them, and the old
Gypsy man gathered some coils of rope together.
</p>
<p>
Ruth insisted on accompanying Barbara, and
the two girls led the way through the wood to
the road, the men following with the horses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
They found the automobile exactly as it had
been left, save in one particular. The murderous-looking
dagger was gone. But the suit
cases and numerous dress boxes were untouched.
</p>
<p>
The girls waited at one side while the Gypsies
secured the ropes to the car and then to the collars
of the horses. Two Gypsies walked on
either side, holding the reins, while the other
two ran to the back and began to push the machine.
The horses strained at the ropes; then
in an instant the automobile was moving easily,
urged from the back and pulled from the front
like a stubborn mule.
</p>
<p>
When the girls again reached that part of the
road opposite the camp, the caravan came to a
full stop.
</p>
<p>
Ruth directed that all the cushions be carried
to the tent, together with the steamer rugs
stored under the seats, the tea-basket and other
luggage. The dismantled automobile was then
left for the night.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Bab found Miss Sallie waiting at
the tent, a tragic figure in the darkness.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII‚ÄîA NIGHT WITH THE GYPSIES</h2>
<p>
‚ÄúI think we shall be comfortable enough,
Aunt Sallie,‚Äù said her niece, after their
belongings had been deposited in the
tent. ‚ÄúWe will fix you a nice bed, auntie, dearest,
with steamer rugs and your rubber air
cushion, and for the first time in your life you
will be almost sleeping under the stars.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But poor Miss Sallie only smiled in reply.
She was too weary and exhausted to trust the
sound of her own voice, now that danger was
over and they had found protectors.
</p>
<p>
While Grace and Ruth arranged three beds inside
the tent (Ruth and Bab having joyfully
elected to sleep just outside) the two sisters
made tea and opened up boxes of tea biscuits
and Swiss chocolate which were always kept in
the provision basket for emergencies.
</p>
<p>
Granny Ann had offered them food, but they
had courteously declined, remembering tales
they had heard of the unclean Gypsy, and giving
as an excuse that they had a light supper
with them. ‚ÄúVery light indeed,‚Äù commented
Ruth later; ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll starve.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow that everything is comfy,‚Äù observed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
Grace, ‚ÄúI, for one, think it is great fun. Our
little house in the woods! For one night, it is
almost as good as the cabin in the Berkshires.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, for one night; but give me a roof when
the rain comes,‚Äù cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are safe for to-night, at any rate,
Ruth,‚Äù said Barbara, looking up at the sky
through the branches of the tall forest trees.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a cloud, even as small as a man‚Äôs
hand. And how bright the stars are! There
comes the harvest moon. It looks like a great,
red lantern.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMoney, money!‚Äù cried Mollie excitedly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat is the matter with you, child?‚Äù said
Miss Sallie, startled into finding her voice at
last.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù said Mollie. ‚ÄúIt was a
splendid shooting star. It had a tail that
reached halfway across the heavens. Don‚Äôt you
know that, if you remember to say ‚Äòmoney,
money, money,‚Äô before it fades out of sight or
goes wherever it disappears to‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚Äú‚ÄòOh, mother, where do the shooting stars
go‚Äô?‚Äù laughed Ruth, breaking in upon Mollie‚Äî‚Äúyou
will inherit a large sum of money,‚Äù continued
Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe shall be sleeping at the feet of an heiress,
then,‚Äù said Bab. ‚ÄúOr did the star fade out
before you had finished, Molliekins?‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù replied Mollie. ‚ÄúI was so
excited that I forgot to look.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
By this time tea was ready and a rug had
been spread in front of the tent for the guests
to sit upon. Miss Sallie with her air cushion
between her shoulders and the trunk of a tree
that spread its branches over the tent, was beginning
to feel that life, after all, held a number
of pleasant things, including a certain favorite
blend of tea that was as delicious, fragrant
and expensive as heart could wish.
</p>
<p>
The night breeze touched their faces gently,
and the stillness and sweet scents of the woods
soothed them into forgetfulness of their troubles.
While they sipped their tea and talked, in subdued
voices, of the mystery of the forest at
night, the Gypsy girl crept up and gazed curiously,
almost wistfully, at them.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo have some chocolate,‚Äù called Ruth, as
she held the box toward the girl. ‚ÄúCome over
and sit down, won‚Äôt you? What is your
name?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy name is Zerlina,‚Äù replied the Gypsy, as
she nibbled gingerly at a piece of chocolate.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd is Granny Ann your mother?‚Äù asked
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShe is my grandmother,‚Äù replied Zerlina.
‚ÄúMy mother died many years ago.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth looked at her sympathetically. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
had, she thought, at least one thing in common
in their widely separated circumstances.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWould you like,‚Äù she asked gently, ‚Äúto live
in a city and go to school?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
For a moment Zerlina‚Äôs face flushed with a
deep glow of color. Her eyes traveled from one
to another of the automobile party. She noted
their refined, well-bred faces, their dainty
dresses, the luxurious pile of long silk coats and
chiffon veils. Nothing escaped the child, not
even the elegant little tea basket with its fittings
of silver and French china.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere are times when I hate this life,‚Äù
Zerlina said finally, turning to Ruth, who was
watching her curiously. ‚ÄúThere are times in the
winter when we have been too poor to go far
enough South to keep warm. It is then that I
would like the city and the warm houses. But
my grandmother is very strict.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
She paused and bit her lip. She had spoken
so fiercely that the girls had felt somewhat embarrassed
at their own prosperity. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù
continued Zerlina in a quieter tone, ‚Äúwhen summer
comes, I would rather be here in the woods.
Gypsies do not live in houses,‚Äù she went on a
little proudly. ‚ÄúMy grandmother has told me
that they have been wanderers for thousands of
years. They do not go to school. They teach
each other. My grandmother has taught me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
read and write. She was taught by her mother,
who was adopted and educated by a noble lady.
But she came back to the Gypsies afterwards.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd your mother?‚Äù asked Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy mother is dead,‚Äù returned Zerlina, and
closed her lips tightly, as if to block all further
inquiries in that direction.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is very interesting!‚Äù exclaimed Ruth.
‚ÄúAnd your education is then really inherited
from your great-grandmother.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù assented the girl, ‚Äúbut I have inherited
more than that‚Äîfrom my mother.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls waited for Zerlina to finish. They
hesitated to question her about her mother
since it was evidently a forbidden subject with
her.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have inherited her voice,‚Äù she added confidentially.
‚ÄúIt may be that I shall be a singer
some day.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù cried all the girls in unison.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou will sing for us now, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù
added Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf you wish,‚Äù said Zerlina. ‚ÄúI will get my
guitar.‚Äù And she disappeared in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù commented Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow soft her voice is, and what good English
she speaks,‚Äù marveled Ruth. ‚ÄúBut then,
we must remember her great-grandmother was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
educated by a noble lady and transmitted her
learning and manners straight to her.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPoor thing!‚Äù exclaimed Bab. ‚ÄúI am really
very sorry for her. The instincts of her great-grandmother
and her grandmother keep up a
sort of warring inside of her. In the winter
time she‚Äôs her great-grandmother, and in the
summer time she‚Äôs a real Gypsy. There are
times when she sighs for a steam-heated house,
and times when she sighs for the open.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs mostly the open she gets,‚Äù said
Grace. ‚ÄúWhat do you suppose she meant when
she said that Granny Ann was very strict?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine,‚Äù replied Ruth, ‚Äúunless
Granny Ann refuses to allow her to buy herself
a warm house. Seriously, though, I should like
to do something for a girl like Zerlina. She
strikes me as being far from ordinary. But
here she comes. We will hear her sing first.
This beggar girl may be a future prima-donna.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Zerlina emerged from the darkness, with an
old guitar, and, sitting crosslegged on the
ground, began to thrum an accompaniment.
Then she sang in a deep, rich voice a song of the
Gypsies. The song was in Spanish and the beat
of the music was so weird and insistent that the
listeners could hardly restrain themselves from
joining hands and dancing in time to the rhythm.
</p>
<p>
They were thrilled by the romance of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
Gypsy camp and the charm of the girl‚Äôs singing.
When she had finished they begged for more,
and Zerlina was about to comply when a voice
called her from the encampment. It was her
grandmother‚Äôs, and what she said was not understood,
since it was in the Romany language.
But the girl leaped hurriedly to her feet.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI will not sing again to-night,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúThe ladies are tired. Another time. Good-night,‚Äù
And she slipped away in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGranny Ann is strict,‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúYou
wouldn‚Äôt think she would object to Zerlina‚Äôs
associating with a few girls her own age. I
wonder why she doesn‚Äôt like to have her sing?
Perhaps she is afraid she will run away, some
day, and go on the stage.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI wish I had her beautiful voice,‚Äù sighed
Grace. ‚ÄúThink what it could be made with
proper training.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf she does not coarsen in feature, as so
many of these dark women do,‚Äù observed Miss
Sallie, ‚Äúshe will be very handsome some day.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd now for our lowly beds,‚Äù cried Ruth.
‚ÄúBarbara, you and I will sleep at the door of
the tent like faithful slaves guarding their noble
ladies. Nobody need be afraid. Granny Ann
has promised to have a Gypsy man keep watch,
and I have pinned my faith to Granny Ann. I
believe she‚Äôs a woman of her word.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMollie, you seem to be on such friendly
terms with these people. What is your
opinion?‚Äù asked Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI believe we shall be as safe as if we were
in our own homes,‚Äù replied Mollie. ‚ÄúGranny
Ann will keep faith with us. You will see.
Perhaps she wouldn‚Äôt if she didn‚Äôt feel under
obligations for a few sandwiches and lemonades,
and things that I have made for her occasionally
in the summer on hot days. But I know
she‚Äôs a kind of queen in the tribe, and used to
being obeyed.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Fifteen minutes had hardly slipped past when
Miss Sallie and ‚ÄúThe Automobile Girls‚Äù were
sound asleep, Bab with her pistol at her side.
</p>
<h2><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE HAUNTED POOL</h2>
<p>
To be awakened early in the morning by
the songs of birds and innumerable
woodland sounds, and find one‚Äôs self in
the very center of a forest, is no common experience.
To the girls, as they looked up
through the leafy canopies, and then across the
green aisles formed by trees that looked as if
they might have stood there since the beginning
of time‚Äîit was all very wonderful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow beautiful this is!‚Äù exclaimed each one,
as she opened her eyes upon the wooded scene.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls,‚Äù cried Ruth, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have missed
this for worlds! No wonder Zerlina hates to
live in a house in the summer time. Isn‚Äôt this
fun? Shall we go over there and wash our
faces in that little brook!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Off they scampered, a curious procession for
the deep woods, each with a burden of toilet
articles, soaps and sponges, wash rags, mirrors
and brushes.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie Stuart as she
knelt beside the stream and dipped her hands
into its cool depths, ‚ÄúI never expected to come
to this; but it is very refreshing, nevertheless.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is Nature‚Äôs bathtub, auntie, dear. We
should be thankful to have it so near. I suppose
that is the reason the Gypsies chose this
spot to camp in,‚Äù said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dear child,‚Äù replied her aunt, ‚ÄúI know
very little about the Gypsy race; but I do know
one thing: that a Gypsy never took advantage
of any kind of a bathtub, wooden, tin, porcelain
or Nature‚Äôs.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls all laughed joyously.
</p>
<p>
The fright of the day before had not left a
very deep impression. Sleep and a feeling of
safety had almost effaced it.
</p>
<p>
Presently they were back at the tent making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
tea and boiling eggs supplied by Granny Ann
from the Gypsy larder. Ruth wanted to
build a fire, but they decided that the ground
was too dry to risk it. The Gypsies had dug a
small trench all around their camp fire. If they
had not, those splendid old woods would have
been in serious danger of burning, explained
Barbara, who had been reading a great deal in
the papers about forest fires.
</p>
<p>
It was arranged, after breakfast, that one of
the men should ride over with a note to Major
Ten Eyck‚Äôs, asking the major to send for them
at once, and also to dispatch his chauffeur to
mend the slashed tires.
</p>
<p>
The Gypsy camp had been astir long before
the automobilists arose, and the men were now
sitting at their ease around the clearing, smoking
silently, while Granny Ann and two other
women were moving about the tents, ‚Äúcleaning
up,‚Äù as Ruth expressed it.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThey have a lovely chance to learn housework,‚Äù
said Grace. ‚ÄúBut they do seem to air
their bedclothes. Look at all those red comforts
hanging on the bushes.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to air them than to make up the
beds,‚Äù observed Mollie. ‚ÄúAll you have to do
in the morning, is to hang your blanket on a
hickory limb, and when you go to bed, snatch
it off the limb and wrap up in it for the night.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you suppose they sleep in their clothes?‚Äù
pondered Barbara.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, of course they do,‚Äù replied Ruth.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt for a moment imagine they would
ever go to the trouble of undressing, only to
dress again in the morning?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls, girls,‚Äù remonstrated Miss Sallie, ‚Äúwe
must not forget that we are accepting their
hospitality. Besides, here comes that young
woman with the voice.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take Zerlina as a guide, and go for a
walk,‚Äù cried Ruth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so full of life and
spirits this morning that I couldn‚Äôt possibly sit
down like those lazy men over there, who seem
to have nothing to do but smoke and talk.
Auntie, dear, will you go, or shall we fix you a
comfortable seat with the cushions under this
tree and leave you to read your book?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI certainly have no idea of going for a
walk,‚Äù replied Miss Stuart, ‚Äúafter what I‚Äôve
been through with these last two days. Nor do
I want you to go far, either, or I shall be terribly
uneasy.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But Miss Sallie was not really uneasy. It
was one of those enchanting mornings when the
mind is not troubled with unpleasant feelings.
Perhaps the Gypsies had bewitched her. At
any rate she sat back comfortably among the
cushions and rugs, with her writing tablet, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
new magazines and the latest novel all close at
hand, and watched the girls until they disappeared
down the leafy aisles of the forest.
How charming their voices sounded in the distance!
How sweet was the sound of their
young laughter! Miss Stuart closed her eyes
contentedly. The spell of the place was upon
her, and she fell asleep before she had opened
a single magazine or cut one leaf of the new
novel.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the four girls, led by Zerlina
and her dog, were following the little stream in
its capricious windings through the forest.
</p>
<p>
A squirrel darted in front of them with a
flash of gray and jumped to the limb of a tree.
</p>
<p>
Zerlina made a sign for the girls to be silent.
Then speaking to her dog in her own language,
he sat down immediately on his haunches and
never moved a muscle until she spoke to him
again. She walked slowly toward the tree,
where the squirrel sat watching them uneasily.
A few feet off she paused and gave a shrill,
peculiar whistle. The squirrel pricked up his
ears and cocked his head on one side. Zerlina
whistled again and held out her hand. The
charm was complete. Down the limb he crept
until he reached the ground, paused again,
surveyed the scene with his little black eyes, and
with one leap, settled himself on her shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh!‚Äù cried the impulsive Ruth and the spell
was broken.
</p>
<p>
Away scampered the frightened little animal.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow wonderful!‚Äù exclaimed the others as
they gathered around Zerlina, who held herself
with a sort of proud reserve as they plied her
with questions.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is because I have lived in the woods so
much of the time,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúOne makes
friends with animals when one has no other
friends.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúZerlina,‚Äù said Ruth, ‚Äúlet me be your
friend.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù replied the girl simply, ‚Äúbut
perhaps we shall not meet again. You will be
going away in a little while.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou must come and sing for us at Major
Ten Eyck‚Äôs,‚Äù said Ruth, ‚Äúand then we shall see
if we cannot meet again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They were walking in single file, now, along
the stream. Mollie was gathering ferns which
grew in profusion on the bank. Barbara, who
was behind the others, had stopped to look at a
bird‚Äôs nest that had fallen to the ground and
shattered the little blue eggs it had held.
</p>
<p>
As she knelt on the ground, something impelled
her to look over her shoulder. At first
Bab saw only the green depths of the forest, but
in a moment her eyes had found what had attracted them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
Stifling a cry she rose to her feet.
What she had seen was gone in an instant, so
quickly that she wondered if she had not been
dreaming. Peering at her through the leaves
of parted branches she had seen a face, a very
strange, old face, as white as death. It was the
face of an old person, she felt instinctively, but
the eyes had something childlike in their expression
of wonder and surprise.
</p>
<p>
When it was gone, Barbara felt almost as if
she had seen a ghost. She leaned over and
dipped her hands into the stream to quiet her
throbbing veins.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTruly this wood is full of mysteries,‚Äù she
thought to herself as she turned to follow the
others. But she decided not to say anything
about it. They had had enough frights lately,
and she was determined not to add another to
the list.
</p>
<p>
By this time the girls had reached a lovely
little pool set like a mirror in a mossy frame.
On one side the bank had flattened out and was
carpeted with luxuriant, close-cropped grass,
almost as smooth as the lawn of a city park.
The trees had crowded themselves to the very
edge of the greensward. They closed up on
the strip of lawn like a wall and stretched their
branches over it, as if to shield it from the sun.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDid you ever see anything so sweet in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
your life?‚Äù cried Ruth, as she flung herself on
the turf.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNever!‚Äù agreed the others with enthusiasm,
following her example.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis pool is supposed to be haunted,‚Äù said
Zerlina, and Bab started, remembering the face
she had just seen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHaunted by what, Zerlina?‚Äù she asked.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is not known,‚Äù replied the Gypsy girl,
mysteriously; ‚Äúbut on moonlight nights some
one is often seen sitting on this bank.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat some one‚Äîa man or a woman?‚Äù persisted
Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is not known,‚Äù repeated Zerlina. ‚ÄúBut
it has been seen, nevertheless. Besides,‚Äù she continued,
‚Äúthis is supposed to be the meeting-place
of fairies. Though people do not believe in
fairies in this country.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI do,‚Äù declared Mollie, and the other girls
laughed light-heartedly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù went on Zerlina, ‚Äúthe deer who live
in this wood come here to graze and drink water
from the pool.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, that I can believe,‚Äù said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, it is an enchanted spot,‚Äù cried Mollie.
‚ÄúIt must be. Look at Zerlina‚Äôs dog.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The shepherd dog had taken his tail in his
mouth and was circling slowly. The girls
watched him breathlessly as he turned faster
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
and faster. Once he fell into the stream, but he
never stopped and continued to circle so rapidly,
as he clambered out, that he lost all sense of direction
and waltzed over the girls‚Äô laps, staining
their dresses with his wet feet, while they
laughed until the tears rolled down their cheeks,
and the woods rang with the merry sound.
</p>
<p>
At a word from the Gypsy girl the dog stopped
and stretched himself exhausted, on the ground.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúZerlina, you must have bewitched that animal,‚Äù
cried Ruth. ‚ÄúBut wasn‚Äôt it beautiful?
If we had been lying down he would have
waltzed right over our faces.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls,‚Äù proposed Grace, after they had recovered
from the exhibition of the waltzing dog,
‚Äúlet‚Äôs go in wading.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat a great idea, Grace!‚Äù cried Ruth. In
a jiffy they had their shoes and stockings piled
together on the bank and had slipped into the
little pool of clear, running water.
</p>
<p>
Zerlina watched them from the bank. Perhaps
Miss Sallie was right, and water had no
charms for this Gypsy child.
</p>
<p>
As they clung to each other, giving little
shrieks of pleasure and making a great splashing,
Mollie exclaimed suddenly:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLook, look! Here comes a man!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Sure enough there was a man emerging from
the trees on the other side of the stream. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
girls scampered excitedly out of the water, giggling,
as girls will do, and sat in a row on the
bank, tailor-fashion, hiding their wet feet under
their skirts.
</p>
<p>
By this time the stranger had come up to the
pool and stood gazing in amazement at the party
of young women.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, for the love of Mike!‚Äù he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
It was Jimmie Butler, one of the major‚Äôs
house party.
</p>
<p>
Then he caught sight of the pyramid of shoes
and stockings; his face broke into a smile and
he laughed so contagiously that everybody joined
in. Once more the enchanted pool was given
over to merriment.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhere on earth did you come from?‚Äù demanded
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd where have you been?‚Äù he echoed.
</p>
<p>
Whereupon everybody talked at once, until all
the adventures had been related.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre actually alive, after all these
hairbreadth escapes, and able to amuse yourselves
in this simple fashion?‚Äù gasped Jimmie
Butler. ‚ÄúLadies, putting all joking aside, permit
me to compliment you on your amazing
nerve. I don‚Äôt think I ever met a really brave
woman before, and to be introduced to five at
once! Why, I feel as if I were at a meeting of
suffragettes!‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut how did you happen to be here?‚Äù repeated
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm just out for a morning stroll,‚Äù he
replied. ‚ÄúI came to see the haunted pool.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJust take another little stroll, for five minutes,
until we get on our shoes and stockings.
Then we‚Äôll all go back to our home of canvas,‚Äù
said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
By the time they had reached the encampment
Bab had almost forgotten about the
strange face she had seen, and they were all
talking happily together about Ten Eyck Hall,
which, according to Jimmie Butler, was the finest
old house in that part of the country.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime the major himself had arrived
in his automobile, while the boys had ridden
over on horseback. When the others came
up, they found the chauffeur busily engaged in
repairing the tires of Ruth‚Äôs automobile. Miss
Stuart and Major Ten Eyck were deep in conversation,
while the Gypsies stood about in
groups, looking at the strangers indifferently.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMiss Ruth,‚Äù said the major, after greetings
had been exchanged, ‚Äúif you can run this machine,
suppose we start at once and leave my
chauffeur to follow with yours. You ladies
must be very hungry. We will have an early
luncheon.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls said good-bye to the Gypsies and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
thanked them graciously. Ruth had tried to
compensate Granny Ann, but the old woman had
haughtily refused to accept a cent.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúA Gypsy takes nothing from his guest,‚Äù she
said, and Ruth was obliged to let the matter
drop. However, she made the old Gypsy promise
to bring her granddaughter over to see them
very soon, and as they disappeared down the
road, they saw Zerlina leaning against a tree,
watching them wistfully.
</p>
<p>
At last, the journey which had been so full
of peril and adventure was ended, and ‚ÄúThe Automobile
Girls‚Äù arrived safely at Ten Eyck Hall.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX‚ÄîTEN EYCK HALL</h2>
<p>
Ten Eyck Hall, with its high-peaked
roofs, its rambling wings and innumerable
dormer windows, seemed to the four
girls the very home of romance.
</p>
<p>
It was an enormous house built of brick,
turned a faded pink, now, from age, which made
a delicate background for the heavy vines that
shaded the piazzas and balconies and clambered
up to the roof itself.
</p>
<p>
The handsome old master of this charming
house leaped to the ground as lightly as one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
his nephews, the moment the automobile drew
up at the front door. Lifting his hat he made
a low, old-fashioned bow.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear ladies,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou are as welcome
to my home as the flowers in spring!‚Äù Giving
his arm to Miss Stuart, he conducted her up the
front steps. The great double doors flew open
as if by magic, and the party filed into the vast
center hall, on each side of which stood the servants
of the household, headed by the butler and
his wife, the housekeeper.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear me,‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie, ‚ÄúI feel as
if I were entering a baronial castle. Why did
you never tell me years ago you owned such a
fine place, John Ten Eyck?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBecause I didn‚Äôt in those days, Sallie,‚Äù answered
the major. ‚ÄúThere were several heirs
ahead of me then. But I always wanted you to
come and see it. Don‚Äôt you remember my
mother wrote and asked you to make us a visit?
But you were going abroad, that summer, and
couldn‚Äôt come.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, I was a very foolish girl,‚Äù replied
Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúBut better late than never, John,
and it will be a pleasure to see the young people
enjoy themselves in this beautiful house.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Some of the young people were already
plainly showing their delight and pleasure in the
visit. The major made a smiling gesture toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
four young girls, who, with arms
around each other‚Äôs waists, were strolling up the
great hall toward the fireplace at the far end,
pausing here and there to look at the fine old
portraits and curious carved cabinets and settees.
Many of the latter had been collected by
the major during his travels abroad.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI feel like a princess in a castle, Major,‚Äù
called Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd here comes one of the princes, my
dear,‚Äù answered the major, glancing up at the
broad staircase which occupied one side of the
hall. All eyes followed the direction of his gaze,
and an exclamation of surprise escaped the lips
of the automobilists. For there, on the landing
of the staircase, looking down at the little
group of people below as calmly as a real prince
might regard his subjects, was the motor cyclist.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs Mr. Martinez!‚Äù exclaimed Miss
Sallie. ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù she said graciously,
as he descended the broad staircase. ‚ÄúWe
had no idea you were a friend of the major‚Äôs,
too.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNor had I, Madam,‚Äù replied the young man,
as he bowed low over Miss Stuart‚Äôs hand and
acknowledged the greetings of the girls. ‚ÄúI
did not know who Major Ten Eyck was when he
was stopping at the hotel, or I should have presented
my letter there. It was a surprise to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
find in him the same gentleman I had come down
to meet, and it is, indeed, a great pleasure and
surprise to meet you and the young ladies so
soon again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMartinez is the son of an old friend of mine,
Jos√© Martinez of Madrid,‚Äù broke in the major.
‚ÄúBut how did you happen to meet him?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Miss Stuart explained that he was the brave
young man who had saved them from the attack
of the drunken tramp.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dear Jos√©,‚Äù exclaimed the major, grasping
him cordially by the hand, ‚Äúyou were brave.
It was an act worthy of your father, and I can
say no more for you than that.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The young man flushed, and for the first time
in their acquaintance showed signs of real embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was nothing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe man was
drunk and drunken men are easy to manage.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut he was not easy to manage,‚Äù exclaimed
Ruth. ‚ÄúHe was a giant in size and strength.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The young foreigner shrugged his shoulders
and the flush deepened on his face.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù laughed Major Ten Eyck, ‚Äúwe
won‚Äôt embarrass you any more by insisting on
your being a hero whether you will or no. Here
comes Mary to show you to your rooms, ladies.
You look as fresh as the morning, but after a
night spent in a Gypsy camp perhaps you would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
like to spruce up a bit before luncheon. Come
along, Jos√©, and let me show you my library. I
am very proud of my collection of Spanish
books. I want your opinion of them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The major waved his hand gallantly to the
five women who were following the housekeeper
up the carved oak staircase to the regions
above.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAm I awake, or asleep?‚Äù asked Mollie.
‚ÄúThis whole morning has seemed like a dream,
and now this lovely old house‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the lovely old major, in the lovely old
house,‚Äù added Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he a dear!‚Äù pursued Mollie. ‚ÄúI wonder
if Miss Sallie is sorry now,‚Äù she continued
to herself. ‚ÄúIf he were as gentle and charming
when he was young as he is now, I don‚Äôt
think I could have been cross with him, ever.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Barbara was saying to Miss Stuart:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo; we never told Mr. Martinez where we
were going, or mentioned the major‚Äôs name, so
of course he had no way of knowing that we
were coming here. It is curious, though,‚Äù she
went on thoughtfully, ‚Äúour meeting him here.
I wonder when he arrived?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYesterday, I suppose,‚Äù replied Miss Sallie.
‚ÄúOr it may have been this morning. However,
it doesn‚Äôt make any difference. I am glad, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
least, that a friend of ours can show him some
hospitality in return for his courageous act.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
By this time they had reached the top of the
stairs and had a glimpse of another hall corresponding
to the one below, at one end of which
was a great casement window with a broad
cushioned window-seat under it. The other end,
where the stairs turned, was lighted by an enormous
stained glass window.
</p>
<p>
Little exclamations of rapture escaped the
girls as they tripped over the softly carpeted
floors to their rooms, which were on the left side
of the hall. Opposite were the major‚Äôs rooms,
so Mary explained, while the young men were
all quartered in the right wing except Mr. Martinez,
who had a room at the end of the hall on
the same side as the major‚Äôs suite.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI could live and die in a house like this, and
never want to leave it,‚Äù cried Bab, her eyes
sparkling with pleasure as Mary opened the door
leading to the room that had been assigned to
Ruth and her.
</p>
<p>
They could have a room apiece, if they wished
it, the housekeeper said, but when it was discovered
that this would necessitate two of the girls
taking rooms in the right wing, many passages
and corridors away from the others, all said they
would rather share the rooms on the main hall.
Mary looked somewhat relieved at this. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
evident she was not in favor of the right wing
for the girls, either; although she did not explain
her reasons.
</p>
<p>
In the large old-fashioned bedrooms, hung
with chintz curtains and furnished with mahogany
that would have been the joy of the antique
dealers, were already placed the boxes and
satchels of the automobilists. Two neat housemaids
were engaged in unpacking their things
and placing them in the drawers of the massive
highboys and wardrobes.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, giving her friend an
affectionate little shake, ‚Äúthis is worth two highwaymen
and a night in a Gypsy camp. I feel as
if I were in an English country house. I feel we
are going to have a perfectly wonderful time.
And, somehow, the young Spaniard adds muchly
to the whole thing. He seems to belong in the
midst of carved oak and Persian rugs, doesn‚Äôt
he, Barbara, dear? As he stood on those steps
he looked like an old Spanish portrait. All he
needed was a velvet cape, a sword and a
plumed hat.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, that seems a good deal to complete the
picture, considering he was wearing an ordinary
pepper and salt suit,‚Äù observed Barbara.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you like Senor Jos√© Martinez,‚Äù
said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes I do,‚Äù replied the other. ‚ÄúI like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
him and I don‚Äôt like him. His eyes are just a
bit too close together, and still he is very handsome.
But give me time, give me time. I don‚Äôt
enjoy having my likes hurried along like this.
If he can play tennis, ride horseback and dance
as well as he can knock down a tramp, he will
be a perfect paragon among men. Look here,
Ruth,‚Äù she continued, exploring the various
closets, ‚Äúdo you know we have a bathroom all to
ourselves? Did you say that Major Ten Eyck
was poor when Miss Sallie threw him over?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, he wasn‚Äôt rich at that time,‚Äù replied
Ruth; ‚Äúthat is, not according to Aunt Sallie‚Äôs
ideas, but since then, she tells me, an uncle has
left him lots of money.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, for a bath!‚Äù cried Barbara, as she
turned the water on in the tub.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use too much of it,‚Äù called Ruth. ‚ÄúI
never saw a country house where the water
didn‚Äôt run short, no matter how grand a place it
was. Remember the drought, Bab, and leave a
little for your fainting friend.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls had barely time to bathe and dress,
when a deep gong sounded in the hall. The five
automobilists, refreshed by their belated baths,
and dainty in crisp ducks and muslins, filed down
the great staircase at the sound. Miss Stuart,
in a lavender organdie, her white hair piled on
top of her head, led the procession.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
The major, waiting for them at the foot of
the steps, smiled rather sadly as he watched the
charming picture. The five young men grouped
together at the end of the hall, came forward
at sight of the ladies. Three of them at least
were rather shy in their greetings, especially
the English boy, Alfred Marsdale, who was only
seventeen and still afraid of American girls.
Stephen and Martin Ten Eyck, boys of sixteen
and seventeen, were also rather green in the society
of girls. They had no sisters and their
vacations had been spent either at Ten Eyck
Hall or out West on their father‚Äôs ranch. And
an avalanche of four pretty, vivacious young
women, advancing upon them in this way, was
enough to make them tongue-tied for the moment.
Jimmie Butler, who was nineteen and
had seen a deal of life all over the world with
his mother, a well-to-do widow, was proof
against embarrassment, and the young Spaniard
also seemed perfectly at his ease.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome along, young people,‚Äù said the major,
giving his arm to Miss Sallie and leading the
way to the dining room.
</p>
<p>
Soon they were all gayly chatting at an immense,
round table of black oak, so highly polished
that it reflected the silver and china
and the faces of the guests in its shining
board.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMiss Barbara,‚Äù said the major, ‚Äúsuppose
you let us have a history of the attempt at robbery?
Since it was your courage and presence
of mind that drove the robber away you ought
to be the one to give the most connected account.
Miss Stuart tells me that he was a giant with a
deep bass voice, but that the sight of a pistol
made him cut and run like a rabbit. You have
not heard, Jos√©,‚Äù continued the major, turning
to Martinez, ‚Äúthat our ladies were in danger of
being robbed last night and would have been
but for Miss Barbara, who drove off the robber
with a pistol?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs it possible?‚Äù replied Jos√©, looking at
Barbara with admiration. ‚ÄúBut there must be
a great many robbers in this country. Almost
as numerous as in the mountains of my own
country. And what was the appearance of the
robber, may I ask, Miss Thurston? Was he
again a tramp?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe was not a giant,‚Äù answered Barbara.
‚ÄúHe struck me as being rather short and very
slender, so slender that it made him appear taller
than he was. His voice was curious. I could
not describe it, and I think really it was disguised.
He spoke only a few times. He wore
a mask that completely covered his face, and a
slouch hat, so there was no telling what his hair
was like; but he gave me the impression of being dark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
I think he was a coward, because he
ran so fast when I pointed the pistol at him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you suppose he‚Äôs hiding in the woods
now, Major?‚Äù asked Mollie. ‚ÄúWe were walking
there all morning, but we had nothing to be
robbed of.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, he is probably running still,‚Äù replied
the major. ‚ÄúBut what is quite plain to me is
that it was somebody who knew you expected
to make the trip. This robber had evidently
prepared beforehand for the attack. He had
chopped holes in the bridge, painted the sign,
fastened the ropes across, and had arranged the
whole thing during the morning. But he had
not reckoned on your little pistol, Miss Barbara,
had he? Ah, you are a brave girl, my dear,
and they tell me that this is only one among
many acts of heroism of yours.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Barbara blushed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am sure any of the others would have done
the same thing, Major, if Mr. Stuart had given
them the pistol.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo the ladies in America carry firearms?‚Äù
asked Alfred Marsdale, looking from one to
another in a hesitating, embarrassed way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, certainly, Alfred, my boy,‚Äù replied
Jimmie Butler. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know it‚Äôs dangerous,
in this country, for a woman to walk on
the streets unarmed unless she is dressed like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
a suffragette? And then she doesn‚Äôt need a pistol
to make people run from her.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre joking, Jimmie,‚Äù said Alfred.
</p>
<p>
At which everybody laughed until they all felt
that they had known each other much longer
than just a few hours.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhile I think of it,‚Äù observed the major, ‚ÄúI
have only one request to make of my guests,
and that may seem like a very inhospitable one,
but you will all understand, I know. Don‚Äôt be
too lavish with the water.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Barbara looked at each other and
smiled.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù continued the major, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fill the
tubs to the brim. A hand‚Äôs depth is the allowance;
or we shall be high and dry without any
water and no prospect of any unless a rain
comes. This interminable drought has dried up
every brook on the place and the cisterns are
lower than they have ever been before. We
keep one cistern always full‚Äînot so much in
case of drought as in case of fire; it might be
needed some day.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They all promised to bathe in what Jimmie
Butler called ‚Äútwo-fingers of water.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf the water gives out,‚Äù said Jimmie, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll
beautify our complexions by bathing in milk.
I think I need a lotion for a delicate skin, anyhow.‚Äù
Jimmie‚Äôs nose was a mass of freckles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou would have to have your face peeled,
Jimmie,‚Äù said Stephen, ‚Äúbefore you could call
it delicate.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù replied Jimmie, ‚Äúmy indelicate
skin then.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have not made any plans for your entertainment
this afternoon, young ladies,‚Äù the
major was saying. ‚ÄúMiss Stuart is determined
that you must lie down and sleep off the effects
of the Gypsy camp. But to-morrow we shall
have a picnic to make up for it, and Miss Ruth
may take her tea basket, since we have none in
this household.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a bit tired now,‚Äù said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNeither are we,‚Äù echoed the other girls as
they rose from the table.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, suppose we make a compromise,‚Äù said
the major, ‚Äúby showing you over the house?
After that sleep must be your portion, eh, Sallie?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt must, indeed,‚Äù replied that lady firmly,
and all adjourned to the library.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X‚ÄîAN ATTIC MYSTERY</h2>
<p>
The library of Ten Eyck Hall was, to
Bab, the most beautiful of all the rooms.
The walls were literally lined with
books from floor to ceiling, and there were little
galleries halfway up for the convenience of getting
books that were too high to reach from the
floor. Big leather chairs and couches were scattered
about and heavy curtains seemed to conceal
entrances to mysterious doors and passages
leading off somewhere into the depths of the old
house.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is just the place for a secret door or a
staircase in the wall,‚Äù exclaimed Grace.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere is a secret door, I believe, in this very
room,‚Äù replied the major; ‚Äúbut it is really a
secret, for the location was lost long ago and
nobody has ever been able to find it since.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow interesting!‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you
thump the walls and locate it by a hollow
sound?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, even if you discovered a hollow sound,
you wouldn‚Äôt know how to open the door,‚Äù said
Martin.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPress a panel, my boy. That is all that is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
necessary,‚Äù replied Jimmie. ‚ÄúWith a wild
shriek Lady Gwendolyn rushed through the
portals of the lofty chamber. With trembling
hands she pressed a panel in the wainscot. Instantly
it flew back and disclosed a secret passage.
Another instant and she had disappeared.
The panel was restored to its place and Sir
Marmanduke and her pursuers were foiled.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
All this, the irrepressible Jimmie had acted
out with wild gesticulations.
</p>
<p>
They all laughed except Alfred Marsdale, who
stood looking at Jimmie in a dazed sort of way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWake up, Al, old man! What‚Äôs the matter
with you?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, nothing,‚Äù replied Alfred, ‚ÄúI was only
wondering where I had read that before.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was another laugh, and the major led
the way to the red drawing room. It had been
the ball room in the old days.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long time,‚Äù observed the major, ‚Äúsince
anyone has danced on these floors.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The room took its name, evidently, from the
red damask hangings and upholstering of the
furniture. The walls were paneled in white and
gold and there was a grand piano at one end.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to take turn about playing,‚Äù said
Ruth. ‚ÄúGrace and I each play a little.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, Jimmie can play,‚Äù replied Martin. ‚ÄúIs
there anything Jimmie can‚Äôt do?‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJimmie, you‚Äôre a brick,‚Äù said Alfred.
</p>
<p>
Back of the red drawing room was another
smaller room which, the major said, had always
been called a morning parlor, but it had been a
favorite room of the family when he was a
young man, and had been used as a gathering
place in the evening as well as after breakfast.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is the prettiest room of all, I think,‚Äù
observed Mollie.
</p>
<p>
And it was certainly the most cheerful, with
its brightly flowered chintz curtains and shining
mahogany chairs and tables.
</p>
<p>
After that came a billiard room, a small den
used as a smoking room, and a breakfast room.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWho wants to see the attic?‚Äù said Martin.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe all do?‚Äù came in a chorus from the young
people.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, girls,‚Äù protested Miss Sallie, ‚Äúremember
you were to take your rest this afternoon.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, we shan‚Äôt be up there long,‚Äù said Martin.
‚ÄúWe promise you to bring them back in
time for the beauty sleep.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù answered Miss Sallie; ‚Äúgo along
with you. It‚Äôs very hard to be strict, Major.
Don‚Äôt you find it so!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI never even tried the experiment, Sallie,‚Äù
replied the gentle old soldier, ‚Äúbecause I always
found it harder on me than on the boys. It‚Äôs
really a certain sort of selfishness on my part,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
I suppose. Cut along now, boys, and don‚Äôt keep
the girls from their rest too long.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The pilgrimage started up the great front
staircase, led by Martin and his older brother,
who together had made many excursions to the
attic and knew the way by heart.
</p>
<p>
On the second floor the explorers followed a
passage that led to another flight of stairs, and
this in turn to another passage, and finally to
one last narrow flight of steps with a mysterious
door at the top.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis reminds me of the House of Usher,‚Äù
said Jimmie, ‚Äúonly it goes up instead of down.
Can‚Äôt you imagine all these doors opening and
closing, and the sound of footsteps on the stairs,
down, down?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Just then Martin opened the door and a gust
of wind blew in their faces. Something flashed
past that almost made the whole party fall backwards
down the steps.
</p>
<p>
Mollie gave a little shriek.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be frightened,‚Äù said Jos√©, who was
standing just behind her. ‚ÄúIt is only a bird.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSomebody must have left the window open,‚Äù
exclaimed Stephen in surprise. ‚ÄúI wonder who
it was? The servants are afraid to come up
here. They believe it is haunted. Lights have
been seen at midnight, shining through some of
these windows, and the only persons who are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
not afraid are the housekeeper and the butler,
who come twice a year, and clean out the dust.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The young people found themselves in a vast
attic whose edges were hidden by dense shadows.
The center was lighted by dormer windows, here
and there, that gleamed like so many eyes from
the high sloping roof. Scattered about were all
sorts of odds and ends of antiquated furniture,
chests of drawers, hair trunks, carved boxes and
spinning wheels.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this great!‚Äù cried Jimmie Butler.
‚ÄúJust the place for handsprings,‚Äù and he began
to turn somersaults like a professional,
while the girls looked on delighted.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStop that, Jim,‚Äù protested Stephen. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll
get yourself filthy and break your neck into the
bargain. You are much too old for such child‚Äôs
play. You‚Äôll have rush of blood to the head and
strain a nerve, and heaven knows you‚Äôve got
enough to strain.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äú‚ÄòIn&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;youth,&nbsp;&nbsp;Father&nbsp;&nbsp;William&nbsp;&nbsp;replied&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;feared&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;would&nbsp;&nbsp;injure&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;brain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;now&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;I‚Äôm&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;sure&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;none;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;do&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;again&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;again!‚Äô‚Äù<br />
</p>
<p>
sang Jimmie as he wheeled over the floor toward
a partition wall which cut off one end of the
great room. Over and over he circled, without
looking where he was going, until suddenly, bang,
his heels hit against the wall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a curious grating noise, a creaking
of rafters, and before their amazed eyes the
wall slid along and disclosed another attic as
large as the first.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie was so bewildered he forgot to pull
himself up from the dusty floor, and lay with
his head propped against an old trunk looking
across the enormous space.
</p>
<p>
Then everybody began talking at once.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis looks to me like smugglers,‚Äù cried Alfred.
‚ÄúI was in an old house in England,
where there was the same sort of wall, only not
so large.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd look,‚Äù called Bab, ‚Äúthere are footsteps
in the dust. Who could have been here lately,
to have left those marks. Do you see? They
come from over there in the right hand corner.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, is it not curious,‚Äù replied Jos√©, ‚Äúthat
they are going away from the wall and not approaching
it? He must have walked out of the
wall. Perhaps there is a secret door there, too.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They rushed across pell mell, and began
thumping the walls, but nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI say, Stephen,‚Äù said Martin, ‚Äúdo you suppose
we had smugglers in our family?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù answered Stephen. ‚ÄúThey
managed to keep it secret if they had.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to be a smuggler,‚Äù cried Martin.
‚ÄúThere would be some excitement in life then.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
But how did you manage to do it, Jimmie? You
are always having things happen to you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù replied Jimmie. ‚ÄúI must
have kicked the panel that worked the spring.
Let‚Äôs see if we can move it back again. Here‚Äôs
the place in the floor,‚Äù and bending over he
pressed on a sliding board in the floor. Instantly
the wall began slipping back in place.
The others leaped back into the first attic, and
in a moment the partition had fitted itself as
snugly as if it never had been moved.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll is as if it never had been,‚Äù exclaimed
Jimmie. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs find the place I kicked.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But try as they would, no one could locate the
spot again.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, of all that‚Äôs curious and mysterious!‚Äù
said Stephen. ‚ÄúJimmie, go and turn a few
more wheels and see if it happens again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Jimmie did as he was bade, and kicked the
wall vociferously from one end to the other but
it never budged an inch.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Martin and the girls were
diving into some old trunks and carved chests
which were filled with clothes of another date,
old-fashioned silks and dimities that had been
worn by the major‚Äôs grandmother and aunts.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere is a trunkful of men‚Äôs things, too,‚Äù
called Stephen, leaving the sliding partition, to
join in the rummage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI say, girls,‚Äù cried Jimmie, ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be
fun to give a fancy dress party some day, and
surprise the major and Miss Stuart?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow delightful!‚Äù exclaimed the girls in one
voice.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, pshaw!‚Äù said Martin, disgusted.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I say now, Jimmie, what a beastly
idea!‚Äù exclaimed Alfred, equally disgusted.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome on, fellows; don‚Äôt throw cold water
on the scheme if the girls like it,‚Äù put in Stephen.
</p>
<p>
And so the party was arranged.
</p>
<p>
All this time Jos√© had never left the partition,
but had kept up a continuous thumping to find
the sliding panel.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúEverybody take a hand, and we will carry
down everything we can find, and then we
won‚Äôt have to make another trip,‚Äù called
Stephen. ‚ÄúCome, Jos√©, we‚Äôre going to dress up.
You‚Äôll have to be a pirate. Here‚Äôs a red sash
and a three cornered hat that will just suit your
style.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
So saying, the cavalcade departed from the
dark old attic, laden with spoils.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf this is to be a surprise on uncle and Miss
Stuart, we had better hide the things, hadn‚Äôt
we?‚Äù observed Martin, who was very cautious
and always thought ahead, once he had decided
to do a thing.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery well. We‚Äôll let Mary take charge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
them and divide them later,‚Äù replied Stephen.
‚ÄúYou had better go take your naps now, girls,‚Äù
he added in a whisper, ‚Äúor we‚Äôll have the old
lady and gentleman on our necks.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The young people separated, the boys taking
a corridor leading to the left wing, the girls
following the main hall. Bab left the others and
started downstairs.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúI left my
handkerchief in the library.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
She confessed to herself, as she descended the
stairs, that she was rather tired. The excitement
of the two past days, her uncomfortable
bed made of a steamer rug spread on the ground,
the night before, and finally the close, dusty air
of the attic had combined to give her a headache
and a feeling of extreme weariness.
</p>
<p>
When she reached the cool, darkened library,
she sat down for a moment in one of the big
chairs and closed her eyes. It was very restful
in there. The sun had left that side of the
house in the shade and the room with its heavy
hangings, its dark leather furniture and rich
rugs was full of shadows.
</p>
<p>
She was almost asleep, a slender little figure
in a great armchair of carved black oak. Her
head dropped to one side and her eyes closed,
when she was awakened with a start by a
draught of cold air. One of the curtains next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
the book shelves bulged out for a moment and
Barbara‚Äôs eyes were fastened on a long, white
hand that drew them aside. Then a face she
had seen in the wood looked from around the
curtain. The eyes met hers, and again that
strange, childlike look of sorrow and amazement
filled them.
</p>
<p>
A dizziness came over Barbara. She closed
her eyes for a moment, and, when she opened
them again, the face, or phantom, or whatever
it was, had gone.
</p>
<p>
Holding her breath to keep from crying out,
Barbara ran from the room as fast as her
trembling knees could carry her. In the hall
she met Jos√©. He looked at her curiously.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMademoiselle, have you seen a ghost?‚Äù he
asked as he stood aside to let her pass.
</p>
<p>
She was afraid to answer, for fear of bursting
into tears.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am sorry,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHas anything
really happened?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But still she refused to speak, and ran up the
stairs.
</p>
<p>
He turned and went into the library, closing
the door after him.
</p>
<p>
There was a queer little smile on his face.
Perhaps he, too, had seen the old man and understood
her look of terror.
</p>
<p>
By the time she reached her room, Bab had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
regained her self-composure, and had again determined
to say nothing about the adventure.
It would only frighten the girls and take away
from the pleasure of the visit.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI‚ÄîJOS√â HAS AN ENEMY</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ÄúI&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;them&nbsp;&nbsp;all,&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;girls,<br />

</p>
<p>
rang out the charming tenor voice of Jos√©, while
he thrummed a delightful accompaniment on the
piano.
</p>
<p>
Dinner was over, and the major, and his guests
were sitting in the moonlight on the broad piazza.
Windows and doors were stretched as
wide as possible; the curtains in the red drawing
room were drawn back and Jos√© was entertaining
the company.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI sing it translated,‚Äù he called, as he finished
the song, ‚Äúthat it may be understood.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Whereupon Jimmie winked at Stephen, and
looked at Mollie; the major smiled indulgently,
and the others were all more or less conscious
that Spaniards always liked blond girls because
they were so rare in Spain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
Mollie herself, however, was unconscious
that she was being sung about. She was looking
out across the moonlit stretches of lawn and
meadows, her little hands folded placidly in her
lap.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you dance as well as sing, Mr. Martinez?‚Äù
she asked in her high, sweet voice.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI can dance, yes,‚Äù replied Jos√©, ‚Äúbut I like
best dancing with another. I do not like to
dance alone.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut there is no one else here who dances
Spanish fancy dances, is there?‚Äù demanded Miss
Sallie.
</p>
<p>
There was a silence.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt all speak at once,‚Äù cried Jimmie. ‚ÄúI
will play for you, Jos√©, if you will try dancing
alone,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI am afraid we can‚Äôt help
you in any of your Spanish dances.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù replied Jos√©. ‚ÄúI will, then, try
a dance of the Basque country, if Madamoiselle
Mollie will be so kind as to lend me her scarf.
I must have a hat also.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
He disappeared through the window and returned
in a moment with a broad-brimmed felt
hat he had found in the hall. Mollie handed
him her pink scarf with a border of wild roses,
and walking composedly up to the end of the
long piazza he stood perfectly still, waiting for
the music to begin. Jimmie struck up a Spanish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
dance with the sound of castanets in the
bass.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that for a tune?‚Äù he called out.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery good, very good,‚Äù answered Jos√©.
Then he started the strange dance while the
others watched spellbound.
</p>
<p>
The boys, who had been rather scornful of a
man‚Äôs dancing fancy dances, confessed afterwards
that there was nothing effeminate in
Jos√©‚Äôs dancing, no pirouetting and twisting on
one toe like Jimmie Butler‚Äôs one accomplishment
in ballet-dancing. They gathered that it
was a sort of bullbaiting dance. It began with
a series of advances and retreats, with a
springy step always in time to the throb of the
music.
</p>
<p>
The young Spaniard was very graceful and
lithe. He seemed to have forgotten that he was
on the piazza of foreigners in a strange country.
The dance grew quicker and quicker. Suddenly
he drew a long curved dagger from his
belt and made a lunge at some imaginary obstacle,
probably the bull he was baiting.
</p>
<p>
Bab, who was nearest the dancer, rose to her
feet quickly, and then sat down rather limply.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe knife, the knife!‚Äù she said to herself.
‚ÄúIt is the highwayman‚Äôs knife!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And now the handsome dancer was kneeling
at Mollie‚Äôs feet offering her the scarf.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
He had risen and was bowing to the company,
when whir-r-r! something had whizzed past his
head, just scratched his forehead and then
planted itself in the wooden frame of the window
behind him.
</p>
<p>
Was Barbara dreaming; or had she lost her
senses?
</p>
<p>
The knife in the wall was the same, or
exactly like the knife Jos√© had been using in the
dance.
</p>
<p>
In a moment everything was in wild confusion.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGo into the house, ladies!‚Äù commanded the
major.
</p>
<p>
The four boys leaped from the piazza, to run
down the assassin, so they thought, but the figure
vaguely outlined for an instant in the shadows
of the trees, was as completely hidden as if the
earth had opened and swallowed it up.
</p>
<p>
Jos√©, in a big chair in the drawing room, was
being ministered to by Miss Sallie and the girls,
while the major, with a glass of water, was standing
over him on one side and the housekeeper,
on the other, was binding his head with a linen
handkerchief.
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>
‚ÄúMajor,‚Äù Miss Sallie was saying, ‚Äúthis country
is full of assassins and robbers. I believe
we shall all be murdered in our beds. I am
really terribly frightened. We have had nothing
but attacks since we left New York. And,
now, this poor young man is in danger. Who
could it have been, do you suppose, and what
good did it do to hurl a knife into the midst of a
perfectly harmless company like that!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe country is a little wild, Sallie,‚Äù replied
the major apologetically, ‚Äúbut I have never
heard of anything like this happening before.
Of course, there are highwaymen everywhere.
There are those Gypsies in the forest. Perhaps
it was one of them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Just then the boys returned, and the attention
of the others was distracted from Jos√©, who still
sat quietly, his lips pressed together.
</p>
<p>
Barbara, who had been standing a little way
off, turned to him quickly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe knife?‚Äù she asked, but stopped without
finishing, for Jos√© had fixed her glance with a
look of such appeal that she could say no more.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù observed Jimmie Butler,
‚Äúwhere is the knife?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSticking in the wall of course,‚Äù replied
Stephen.
</p>
<p>
The two boys ran out on the piazza, but returned
empty-handed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMystery of mysteries!‚Äù cried Jimmie,
‚Äúthe knife is gone!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is impossible,‚Äù exclaimed the major.
‚ÄúWe have not left this room. We could see
anyone who came upon the piazza.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs gone,‚Äù said Jimmie. ‚ÄúWhile you
were nursing Jos√©, somebody must have crept up
and got it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGood heavens!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie.
‚ÄúDo you mean to say that the murderer has been
that close to us again? Do close those windows
and draw the curtains.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, do so,‚Äù said the major. ‚ÄúMary,‚Äù he
continued to the housekeeper, who was entering
at that moment with a basin of water, ‚ÄúI wish
you would have all the men on the place sent
to me. Some of them may be asleep, but wake
them up. We shall scour every part of the
estate to-night. If there‚Äôs anybody hiding
around here we shall rout him out.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Mary hurried off to deliver her orders, while
the boys ran to their rooms to get on tennis
shoes and collect various weapons.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am sorry Jos√© was scratched,‚Äù Martin confided
to Alfred, ‚Äúbut‚Äîwell, this is pretty good
sport, old man. Don‚Äôt you think so?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBy Jove, it is,‚Äù replied Alfred with enthusiasm.
‚ÄúIf that assassin should leap at us in the
dark I should like to give him a nip with this
shillalah. What a beastly coward he was to attack
a man when his back was turned!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And with that, he waved a big knotted club,
one of Stephen‚Äôs possessions, around his head,
and glared ferociously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome on, boys,‚Äù called Stephen. ‚ÄúWe
haven‚Äôt a moment to lose. The man will be
well away if we don‚Äôt hurry. We are going
to ride in twos and divide the place in sections.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In another ten minutes a company of horsemen
rode off in the moonlight, two by two, while
the frightened maid-servants locked and barred
the house doors and windows.
</p>
<p>
Jos√© had begged to be allowed to go along,
but the major had silenced him by saying that
Miss Sallie and the girls needed a protector, and
that under the circumstances it was better for
him to stay at home and look after them. Even
the old major was rather enjoying the zest of
a man-hunt, and his eyes flashed with a new fire
under his grizzled eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
But nothing happened and the assassin remained
at large. The hunters scoured the
country, searched the forest on the outskirts of
the Ten Eyck estate, and woke the sleeping
Gypsies to demand what they knew. The Gypsies
knew nothing, and at midnight the horsemen
returned.
</p>
<p>
The house was silent. Everyone had gone
to bed except Jos√©, who sat in the library listening
for every sound that creaked through the old
place. He met Major Ten Eyck and the boys
at the front door, holding a candle high and peering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
anxiously into the dark to see what quarry
they had brought home.
</p>
<p>
And, when he saw they had no prisoner bound
to the horse with the ropes that the major had
ordered his man to take along, a look of strange
relief came into the Spaniard‚Äôs face. He
breathed a deep sigh, smiled as he thanked them,
said good-night and went up the broad stairway
with the same smile still clinging to his lips.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Bab was stretched out beside
the sleeping Ruth, wide awake, going over
the events of that tumultuous day.
</p>
<p>
She felt that these events had no connection
with each other, and yet deep down in her inner
consciousness she was searching for the link that
bound all the strange happenings together. She
was not quite sure now whether she had seen the
face in the library or not. She had been so
tired and hot. It might, after all, have been a
dream. But the footsteps in the dust on the attic
floor, coming from the wall, what of them?
</p>
<p>
And last, though most strange and mysterious
of all, the two daggers? Jos√© had been saved
just in time from the stigma of suspicion by the
appearance of the other dagger, for, in the moment
she had seen the two, Bab had realized they
were absolutely alike.
</p>
<p>
She could not believe Jos√© was a highwayman,
and yet there were certain things that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
looked very black. It was true he had not
known where they were going, but she imagined
he could have found it out.
</p>
<p>
Was it his figure she had seen behind the curtain
that morning, listening? Whoever it was
heard the exact route of their trip, with explicit
directions from the major. Undoubtedly, Bab
believed, the eavesdropper was the highwayman.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, what did they know about Jos√©?
It is true he had come bearing credentials, but
such things were easily fixed up by experts, and
the major was a simple old fellow who never
doubted anybody until he had to.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Jos√© had every appearance
of being a gentleman. He had proved himself to
be brave by knocking down the tramp twice his
size at Sleepy Hollow. There was an air of
sincerity about him which she could not fail to
recognize. He was graceful and charming.
Everybody liked him, even those who had been
inclined to feel prejudiced at first.
</p>
<p>
Would the Spaniard have dared to use the
same dagger in the dance that he had used to
slash their tires with? It was assuredly amazingly
reckless, and yet he might have trusted to
the darkness and risked it.
</p>
<p>
But the look he gave her when she started to
speak of the twin daggers! What could that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
have meant? Was he trying to shield his own
enemy?
</p>
<p>
Should she speak to the major or should she
say nothing?
</p>
<p>
On the whole, Barbara thought it would be
better to keep quiet for a day or two. It might
be that Miss Sallie would insist on taking them
away after this last attack; but she believed
Ruth‚Äôs and the major‚Äôs prayers would prevail,
and that they would all stay through the visit.
</p>
<p>
They had planned so many delightful parties
it seemed a shame to break up on the very first
day of their visit. And, after all, Miss Sallie
had a great tenderness for the major, a tenderness
lasting through thirty years.
</p>
<p>
Then Barbara dropped off to sleep, and in the
old house only one other soul was still awake
as the clock in the hall chimed the hour of two.
</p>
<p>
In his room, by the light of a flickering candle,
Jos√© sat examining the dagger that had so
baffled Bab‚Äôs curiosity. On his face was an expression
of sorrow and bitterness that would certainly
have aroused her pity had she seen him
that moment. At last he shook his head hopelessly,
muttered something in Spanish, and blew
out the candle.
</p>
<p>
But before getting into bed he picked up the
dagger again.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúEven in America,‚Äù he said in English,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
‚Äúeven in this far country it is the same. But I
will not endure it,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt is too
much!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Putting his dagger under the pillow, he crept
to bed.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII‚ÄîNOSEGAYS AND TENNIS</h2>
<p>
The household was late in pulling itself
together next morning. At half-past
nine, Mary and her husband, John,
had carried trays of coffee and rolls to the rooms
of the guests, informing them, at the same time,
that luncheon would be served at half-past
twelve.
</p>
<p>
Mollie and Grace, in dressing gowns and
slippers, had carried their trays into the room
shared by Ruth and Barbara. Miss Sallie had
followed, looking so charming in her lavender
silk wrapper, elaborately trimmed with lace and
ribbons that all the girls had exclaimed with
admiration; which put the lady in a very good
humor at the outset. Who does not like to be
complimented, especially in the early morning
when one is not apt to feel at one‚Äôs best?
</p>
<p>
To add to the gayety of the company there
was a knock on the door, which, when opened,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
disclosed John bearing a large tray of flowers,
a small nosegay for each of the girls and a
large bunch of dewy sweet peas for Miss Sallie,
all with the major‚Äôs compliments.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat a man he is!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúHe disarms
me with his bunches of flowers just as I
was about to tell him something very disagreeable.
I really don‚Äôt see how I can do it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, please don‚Äôt, auntie, dear!‚Äù exclaimed
Ruth. ‚ÄúI know what it is. We all do. But if
we broke up the party, and went trailing off
home, now that the worst is over, it wouldn‚Äôt do
anybody much good, and think of what a beautiful
time we would be missing. To tell you the
truth, auntie, we are just dying to stay. In
spite of everything we are. Aren‚Äôt we, girls?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, indeed,‚Äù came in a chorus from the
other three girls, a little faintly from Bab perhaps,
but very eagerly from Mollie and Grace.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll see,‚Äù replied Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúBut
it does seem to me that this trip has started off
very badly. Three attacks in as many days.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúYet by the magic
Rule of Three we should have no more. We
have finished now and the curse is lifted.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhen Mollie‚Äôs old Gypsy comes over we
must ask her to tell a few things,‚Äù observed
Grace. ‚ÄúI believe she really can predict the
future. That night when you and Bab had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
gone with the Gypsies to get the automobile I
asked her if she told fortunes, and all she said
was: ‚ÄòI can tell when there is blood on the
moon.‚Äô‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat a horrible idea!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie.
‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you frightened?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, I wasn‚Äôt frightened, because she seemed
to have forgotten me entirely. I really thought,
at the time, she must be talking about her own
affairs. She looked so black and fierce.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps she meant Jos√©‚Äôs blood,‚Äù remarked
Mollie from behind her nosegay of honeysuckle
and mignonette.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, there wasn‚Äôt much of it,‚Äù replied Bab,
‚Äúbecause Jos√© received only a scratch, and lost
scarcely any blood. It was a close shave,
though. Just half an inch nearer and it would
have gone straight through his head.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe seems to be a very remarkable young
man,‚Äù said Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúDid you notice he
never said one word? Just sat there as quietly
as if nothing had happened.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe was thinking,‚Äù answered Barbara. ‚ÄúBut
of course most people would have been too
frightened to think. Did you notice the knife?‚Äù
she ventured.
</p>
<p>
But nobody had, evidently. They had all
been too excited and horror-struck at the time
to have noticed anything.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI saw it was a knife, and that was all,‚Äù said
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI never saw a man dance before,‚Äù observed
Mollie, as if following aloud a train of thoughts
she had been pursuing while the others talked.
‚ÄúI was almost sorry he said he would, but when
I saw what kind of dancing it was I was glad. It
was really and truly a man‚Äôs dance. I think it
must have been a toreador‚Äôs dance, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSomething like this,‚Äù said Ruth, using a
towel for a scarf and a comb for a dagger.
‚ÄúAnd, by the way,‚Äù she continued, pausing as
she pranced around the room, ‚Äúhow did he happen
to have a dagger so handy!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he is a Spaniard, my dear,‚Äù
remarked Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúThese foreigners carry
anything from dynamite bombs to carving
knives. They are always murdering and slashing
one another.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù cried Mollie, excitedly, ‚Äúit was
the Black Hand that tried to kill him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The others all laughed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúReally, Mollie,‚Äù cried Miss Sallie, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt
add any more horrors to the situation. We are
already surrounded by Gypsies, and tramps and
assassins.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut protected, Aunt Sallie, dear,‚Äù protested
Ruth, ‚Äúprotected by five ‚Äògintlemin frinds,‚Äô as
Irish Nora used to say.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, dress yourselves now,‚Äù said Miss Stuart,
making for the door with her silken draperies
trailing after her. ‚ÄúAnd remember, Ruth,
dear, if your father scolds us for staying I shall
lay all the blame on you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I will manage Dad,‚Äù replied Ruth.
</p>
<p>
When the two girls were left alone they did
not speak for a little while. Barbara, who was
sitting on the floor near the window with her
head propped against a pillow, closed her eyes,
and for a moment Ruth thought she was asleep.
A breeze laden with the perfume of the honeysuckle
vines stirred the curtain. Barbara
took in a deep breath, opened her eyes and
sat up.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúdo you know, the smell of
the honeysuckles gives me the queerest sensation?
I feel as if I had been here before, once
long ago, ever so long. I can‚Äôt remember when,
and of course I haven‚Äôt been, but isn‚Äôt it curious?
These old rooms are as familiar to me as
if I had lived in them. I believe I could find
my way blindfolded around the house.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI should like to see you try it,‚Äù replied Ruth,
‚Äúespecially when you struck one of those back
passages that lead off into nowhere in particular.
But you are tired, Bab, dear,‚Äù continued
her friend, leaning over and patting her on the
cheek. ‚ÄúCome along, now, and get dressed. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
told Stephen and Alfred we would play them a
game of tennis some time this morning.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls found the two boys waiting in the
hall to keep their appointment. Alfred was fast
losing his shyness in the presence of these two
wholesome and unaffected girls who could play
tennis almost as well as he could, ride horseback,
run a motor car, repel a highwayman with
a pistol and not lose their heads when they
needed to keep them most. But, what was more
to the purpose, they were not in the least shy or
afraid to speak out. They were full of high
spirits and knew how to have a good time without
appealing constantly to some everlasting
governess who was always tagging after them,
or asking mamma‚Äôs permission. In fact, Alfred
had suffered a change of heart. When he had
heard the house party was to be increased by a
number of girls he had bitterly repented ever
having left England. By this time, however, he
could not imagine a house party without girls,
especially American girls.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI say, you know,‚Äù he said to Ruth as they
strolled toward the beautiful tennis court that
was shaded, at one side, by a row of tall elm
trees, ‚Äúmust I call you Ruth? I notice the
other fellows do?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, well,‚Äù replied Ruth, ‚Äúwe are none of us
actually grown yet and what is the use of so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
much formality before it is really necessary?
What do you do in England?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIn England,‚Äù replied Alfred, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt call
them anything. We don‚Äôt see them except in
the holidays, and then they are only sisters and
cousins.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there any fun in sisters and cousins?‚Äù
asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre not very jolly,‚Äù replied the
candid youth; ‚Äúnot as jolly as you, that is.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth laughed. By this time they had reached
the court and were selecting racquets and tossing
for sides.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen, Ruth and I will play against you
and Barbara,‚Äù said Alfred rather testily.
‚ÄúWhat is the use of tossing when it was arranged
beforehand?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou seem rather eager, Alfred, my boy,‚Äù
replied Stephen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we have no objections,
have we, Barbara?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNone,‚Äù said Barbara, ‚ÄúAt least I haven‚Äôt.
You may, however, when you hear that Ruth
won the championship at Newport last summer.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou look to me like a pretty good player,
too,‚Äù said Stephen.
</p>
<p>
Just then Jimmie Butler appeared, bearing a
hammock and a book.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou can get in the next set, Jimmie,‚Äù called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
Stephen. ‚ÄúWe are just starting in on this
one.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care for the game,‚Äù replied Jimmie.
‚ÄúI prefer a book ‚Äôneath the bough, especially as
this house party seems to go in companies of
twos. Every laddie has a lassie but me, so I‚Äôve
taken to literature.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
He waved his hand toward the garden, and
then toward the walk leading from the house.
</p>
<p>
In the old-fashioned flower garden, a stone‚Äôs
throw from the court, could be seen Miss Sallie
and the major strolling along the paths, stopping
occasionally to examine the late roses and
smell the honeysuckle trained over wicker arches.
</p>
<p>
In the direction of the house appeared Mollie
and Grace, followed by Martin and Jos√©. The
sound of their laughter floated over to Jimmie as
he swung in his hammock.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúKeep away, all,‚Äù he called as he spread himself
comfortably among the cushions and
opened his book. ‚ÄúI intend to enter a monastery
and take the vow of silence, and this is a
good time to begin. It‚Äôs easy because I have
nobody to talk to.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat are you grumbling about, Jimmie?‚Äù
asked the major, who came up just then with
Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, nothing at all, Major,‚Äù replied Jimmie.
‚ÄúI was only saying how delightful it was to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
all you young people walking around this sylvan
place in couples. It reminds me of my lost
youth.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJimmie‚Äôs lonesome,‚Äù exclaimed Martin.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to get up some more excitement
if we want to keep him happy.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù replied the major. ‚ÄúWe will.
The most exciting thing I can think of, just now,
is to take a long ride in the automobiles, or go
driving, whichever the ladies prefer, and wind
up at the forest pool for tea. How does that
strike you, Jimmie?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt sounds fine,‚Äù said Jimmie, ‚Äúif you mean
the haunted pool. It is a beautiful spot, and it
has a new haunt since last you saw it, Major.
It‚Äôs haunted by water nymphs now.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOnly nymphs in wading,‚Äù cried Mollie,
blushing. ‚ÄúJimmie caught us in the act yesterday
morning.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOho!‚Äù exclaimed the major. ‚ÄúYou really
are little girls, after all, are you?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThink of going in wading in that lonesome
spot,‚Äù said Grace, ‚Äúand actually meeting somebody
as casually as if you were walking up
Fifth Avenue?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre likely to meet Jimmie anywhere,‚Äù
said Martin. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a regular Johnnie-on-the-spot.
He is the first person to get up and the
last one to go to bed. Excitements have a real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
attraction for him. Haven‚Äôt they, Jimsy?‚Äù and
Martin gave the hammock such an affectionate
shake that Jimmie nearly fell out on his face.
</p>
<p>
The luncheon gong rang out in the summer
stillness, and they started toward the house,
leaving the players to finish the game.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√©,‚Äù asked the major, putting his arm
through the young Spaniard‚Äôs, ‚Äúhave you any
theories about last night?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Jos√©. ‚ÄúI do not think it will
do any good to hunt for the one who threw the
knife. I have, in my country, an enemy. I believe
it was he.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù cried the major. ‚ÄúHe has followed
you all the way to America, and your life is constantly
in danger?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI do not think he will come again,‚Äù answered
Jos√©. ‚ÄúAt any rate, I am not afraid,‚Äù he added,
shrugging his shoulders, ‚Äúand I can do nothing.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou could have him arrested,‚Äù said Miss
Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, Madam, I could. But it would not be
easy to catch him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear, dear!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúWhat
a dangerous country Spain must be to live in!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo more dangerous than America, Madam,
I find,‚Äù replied Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTrue enough,‚Äù assented Miss Sallie, ‚Äúsince
this is America and not Spain, and we find ourselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
in a perfect hotbed of criminals. My
dear John, I think we shall need a body-guard
if we go out in the open this afternoon.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, Sallie,‚Äù answered the courteous old
man, ‚Äúyou shall have one in me and my nephews
and their friends‚Äîa devoted body-guard, I assure
you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
At luncheon the feeling of good will which
comes to friends who have just found each other,
so to speak, had spread itself. Enjoyment was
in the air and there were no discordant elements.
All their troubles were of the past, and Bab determined
to cast aside her suspicions and regard
Jos√© in the light of a mysterious but otherwise
exceedingly attractive foreigner. When she
looked across the table into his clear, brown
eyes, which regarded her sadly but without a
single guilty quiver of the lids, she could not
but believe that there had been some bitter mistake
somewhere. He was lonely and strange,
and there was something about him that aroused
her pity. Everybody liked him; even Miss Sallie
was attracted by his graceful and gentle
manners.
</p>
<p>
Luncheon over, everyone made ready for the
auto trip, and it was not long before the two
autos carrying a merry party, had set forth.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîCROSS QUESTIONS AND CROOKED ANSWERS</h2>
<p>
After a long ride through the country,
skirting the edge of the forest in which
the highwayman had lurked, and where
the smoke from the Gypsies‚Äô camp fire could be
seen curling up in the distance, the two automobiles
took to the river road.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was steering her own car with Alfred
beside her; behind them on the small seat sat
Jos√© and Mollie, and on the back seat were Bab
and Stephen. As they skimmed over the bridge,
which had been repaired by the major‚Äôs men,
Mollie said to Jos√©:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWas the bridge all right, Mr. Martinez,
when you came over it the other day?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The Spaniard flushed and his eye caught
Bab‚Äôs, who was gazing at him curiously.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, no‚Äîor rather, I do not know,‚Äù he stammered.
‚ÄúI did not come by the bridge but
through the forest.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut how did you find the way?‚Äù asked Mollie,
wondering a little at his embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI asked it,‚Äù he replied, ‚Äúof a Gypsy.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù cried Mollie. ‚ÄúAnd did she
tell you?‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was not a woman,‚Äù went on Jos√©. ‚ÄúIt
was a man.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd did he know the way? Because they
told us they did not, perhaps because they didn‚Äôt
want to be disturbed so late in the evening.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù said Jos√©, and changed the subject
by asking Stephen whose was the large
estate they were now approaching. It was that
of a famous millionaire, and their attention was
for the moment distracted. Jos√© seemed to
breath a sigh of relief and engaged Mollie in
conversation for the rest of the ride, telling her
about his own country, the bull fights and carnivals
and a hundred other things of interest until
the little girl had quite forgotten his confusion
at the mention of the damaged bridge.
</p>
<p>
On the way back the automobiles turned into
the wooded road, but before they reached the
Gypsy camp they turned again into another
road pointed out by Martin in the first car. The
road led directly through the forest to the
haunted pool, where the automobiles drew up.
The pool, in the late afternoon sunlight, was
more enchanting than ever.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is a famous spot in the neighborhood,‚Äù
observed the major. ‚ÄúWhen I was a boy it
was the scene of many a picnic and frolic. People
in these parts were more neighborly in those
days. The girls and boys used to meet and ride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
in wagons or on horseback over here. We ate
our luncheons on this mossy bank; then strolled
about in couples until dark and drove home
by moonlight.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe Gypsy girl told us it was really haunted,
Major,‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúShe even said she had
seen the ghost.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù replied the major, looking up a
little startled, ‚Äúand what sort of ghost was it?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJust a figure sitting here on the bank,‚Äù answered
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh!‚Äù he exclaimed in a tone of evident relief.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Major,‚Äù cried Miss Sallie, ‚Äúone would
think you believed in ghosts.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd so I do, Sallie, my dear,‚Äù declared the
gentle old major, ‚Äúbut only in the ghosts of my
lost youth, which seem to appear to me to-day in
the forms of all these delightful young people.
What about tea, Miss Ruth Stuart?‚Äù he demanded,
turning to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The chauffeur brought out the elaborate tea
basket which had served them so well at the
Gypsy camp and Ruth and Barbara proceeded
to make the tea while the other girls unpacked
boxes of delicious sandwiches and tea cakes.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is a very beautiful spot,‚Äù observed
Jos√©. ‚ÄúIf it were perpetual summer I could
live and die on this mossy bank and never tire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
of it!‚Äù Walking a little apart from the others
he stretched himself out at full length on the
ground, staring up into the branches overhead.
</p>
<p>
Then the other boys, who had been strolling
about under the trees, returned, but they were
not alone. They had espied Zerlina in the
depths of the woods, with her guitar slung over
her shoulder, and persuaded her to go back with
them to the pool.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou see we‚Äôve brought a wandering minstrel
with us,‚Äù cried Jimmie. ‚ÄúShe has promised
to sing us a song of the Romany Rye,
haven‚Äôt you, Zerlina?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls greeted Zerlina cordially. She was
presented to the major, but Jos√©, as she approached,
had turned over on his side and flung
his arm over his head, as if he were asleep.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLeave him alone. He‚Äôs dreaming,‚Äù said
Jimmie. ‚ÄúGive Zerlina some tea and cake, and
then we‚Äôll have a song.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Zerlina ate the cake greedily and drank her
tea in silence. She examined the fresh summer
dresses of ‚ÄúThe Automobile Girls,‚Äù and a look
of envy came into her eyes as she cast them down
on her cotton skirt full of tatters from the
briars and faded from red into a soft old pink
shade. But she was very pretty, even in her
ragged dress, which was turned in at the collar
showing her full, rounded throat and shapely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
neck. She was lithe and graceful, and as she
thrummed on the guitar with her slender, brown
fingers her ragged dress and rough shoes faded
into insignificance. The group of people sitting
on the bank saw only a beautiful, dark-haired
girl with a glowing face and eyes that shone with
a smouldering fire. After a few preliminary
chords she began to sing in a rich contralto
voice. The song again was in the Romany
tongue. It seemed to convey to the listeners a
note of sadness and loneliness.
</p>
<p>
The kind old major was much impressed by
the performance.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúZerlina,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou have a very beautiful
voice, much too beautiful to be wasted. You
must ask your grandmother to bring you over
to Ten Eyck Hall. I should like to hear you
sing again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúZerlina will be a great opera singer, one of
these days,‚Äù predicted Jimmie. ‚ÄúShe will be
singing Carmen, yet, at the Manhattan Opera
House. How would you like that, Zerlina?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The Gypsy girl made no reply. Her eyes
were fastened on Jos√©, who still lay as if asleep,
his back turned to the circle.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShe can dance, too,‚Äù cried Ruth. ‚ÄúShe told
me she could. This would be a pretty place to
dance, Zerlina, where the fairies dance by moonlight.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have no music,‚Äù objected Zerlina.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I can make the music all right,‚Äù said
the irrepressible Jimmie, seizing the guitar and
tuning it up. Then he began to whistle. The
tone was clear and flute-like and the tune the
same Spanish dance he had played for Jos√©.
Zerlina pricked up her ears when she heard the
music and the rhythm of the guitar. It is said
that no Gypsy can ever resist the sound of
music. Now the body of the girl began swaying
to the beat of the accompaniment. Presently
she began to dance, a real Spanish dance full of
gestures and movement. They half guessed the
story woven in, a lover repelled and called back,
coquetted with and threatened; threatened with
a knife which she drew from the blouse of her
dress and then restored to its hiding place; for
the dance ended quickly without disaster, imaginary
or otherwise. Miss Sallie had given a
little cry at sight of another murderous weapon.
But the knife! Had no one seen it, no one
recognized the chased silver handle and the
slightly curved blade? Bab sat as if rooted
to the spot, waiting for somebody to speak,
to cry out that the knife was the same that
had whizzed past Jos√©‚Äôs head the other night.
After all, nobody had really seen it but herself.
She had learned by a former experience
to keep her own counsel, and she decided to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
wait, and not to tell until matters took a more
definite turn.
</p>
<p>
Was it possible this beautiful Gypsy girl
could be a murderess, or one at heart? But, on
the other hand, would she have dared to display
the mysterious dagger in the presence of the
same company? Bab was puzzled and worried.
Was Zerlina a robber also, or was Jos√©, after
all, the robber? Perhaps there was some connection
between them. There must be, since
they had exchanged knives on several occasions.
</p>
<p>
Her reflections were interrupted by a general
movement toward the automobiles. Zerlina was
evidently pleased at the praises she had received,
for her cheeks were flushed with pride.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you let us see your dagger, Zerlina?‚Äù
asked Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes, do!‚Äù begged Mollie. ‚ÄúIt will be
the third dagger we have seen this week; but
this is the first chance we have had to take a
good look at any of them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Zerlina looked at them darkly. Her lips
drew themselves together in a stubborn line.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI cannot, now,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPerhaps,
another time. Good-bye.‚Äù She slipped off
into the woods as quietly as one of the spirits
which were said to haunt the place.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGypsies are so tiresome,‚Äù exclaimed Miss
Sallie. ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt she show her dagger,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
I‚Äôd like to know? And who cares whether she
does or not, anyhow?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf you had ever read any books on Gypsies,
Sallie,‚Äù replied the major, ‚Äúyou would know
that their lives are full of things they must keep
secret if they want to keep out of jail. However,
these Gypsies seem peaceable enough,‚Äù he
added, his kindly spirit never liking to condemn
anything until it was necessary. ‚ÄúBut
what a beautiful girl she is!‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIf
she were properly dressed she would be as noble
and elegant looking as‚Äù‚Äîhe paused for a comparison‚Äî‚Äúas
our own young ladies here. I
wonder if her grandmother would ever consent
to her being educated and taught singing?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, Major,‚Äù cried the impetuous Ruth,
‚Äúkeep on your own preserves! I asked her
first, and I‚Äôm just dying to do it. I know papa
would let me, and wouldn‚Äôt it be a beautiful
thing to launch a great singer upon the public?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt certainly would, my dear,‚Äù replied the
major, ‚Äúand I promise not to meddle, if you had
first choice.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, where‚Äôs Mr. Martinez?‚Äù asked Mollie,
as they climbed into the automobiles and she
missed her companion of the ride over.
</p>
<p>
One of the boys gave a shrill whistle and the
others began calling and shouting. Presently
the answer came from up the stream. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
coming,‚Äù he called and Jos√© appeared. ‚ÄúI was
only taking a little stroll.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy did you wish to miss the Gypsy song
and dance?‚Äù demanded Mollie. ‚ÄúIt was charming.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPardon, Mademoiselle,‚Äù he replied, stiffly,
‚Äúbut I do not care to hear the songs of my country,
or to see its dances in a foreign land.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Mollie was a little piqued by Jos√©‚Äôs short answer,
but she forgave him when he said sadly:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDid you ever know, Madamoiselle, what it is
to be homesick?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut I thought you said you liked America?‚Äù
she persisted.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo I do,‚Äù he replied; ‚Äúnevertheless, there
are times when I feel very lonely. You will
forgive me, will you not. Was I rude?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Stephen said to Barbara:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab, are you a good walker? How would
you like to take a short cut through the woods
to-morrow morning, and visit the hermit who
lives on the other side? We can‚Äôt ride or drive
very well, because it is too far by the road, but
it is only about five miles when we walk. I
haven‚Äôt been there for several years, but I know
the way well. I suppose the hermit is still
alive. At least, he was all right last summer,
so John the butler told me. Anybody else who
wishes may go along, but nobody shall come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
who will lag behind and complain of the distance.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am good for a ten mile walk,‚Äù replied
Barbara. ‚ÄúI have done it many a time at
home.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe woods grow more and more interesting
the deeper you go into them,‚Äù continued
Stephen. ‚ÄúThere are places where the sun
never comes through, and the whole way is cool
and shaded. It is full of people, too. You
would be surprised to find how many people
make a living in a forest. They are perfectly
harmless, of course, or else I wouldn‚Äôt be taking
you among them. Besides the Gypsies,
there are woodcutters, old men and women who
gather herbs, and a few lonely people who live
in cabins on the edge of the forest and have little
gardens. Uncle has always helped them, in
the winter, without asking who they were or
why they were there. Then there‚Äôs the hermit.
He is the most interesting of the lot. He is as
old as the hills and he has a secret that he would
never tell, the secret of who he is and why he
has lived alone for some forty years.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow interesting!‚Äù exclaimed Bab. ‚ÄúI hope
Miss Sallie won‚Äôt object.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe shall have to get the major on our side,‚Äù
replied Stephen, ‚Äúand perhaps win her over,
too.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, she is not really so strict,‚Äù replied Bab,
‚Äúbut she feels the responsibility of looking after
other peoples‚Äô children, she says.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù said Stephen, as the cars
stopped at Ten Eyck Hall.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV‚ÄîIN THE DEEP WOODS</h2>
<p>
It was not such a difficult matter, after all,
to win permission from Miss Sallie and the
major to take the walk through the forest.
The major explained to Miss Sallie that Stephen
was a safe and careful guide who knew the country
by heart, and that if the girls were equal
to the walk there would be no danger in the excursion.
The party, however, dwindled to five
persons, Bab and Ruth, Stephen, Jimmie and
Alfred. The latter appeared early, equipped
for the walk, carrying a heavy cane, his trousers
turned up over stout boots.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, Stephen,‚Äù said Miss Sallie, ‚ÄúI want
you to promise me to take good care of the girls.
You say the woods are not dangerous, although
a highwayman stepped out of them one evening
and attacked us with a knife. But I take your
word for it, since the major says it is safe and
I see Alfred is armed.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
Everybody laughed at this, and Alfred looked
conscious and blushed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt one carry a cane in this country?‚Äù
he asked.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNot often at your age, my boy,‚Äù replied
Jimmie. ‚ÄúBut I daresay it will serve to beat a
trail through the underbrush.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome along, girls; let‚Äôs be off,‚Äù cried
Stephen, who at heart was almost a Gypsy, and
loved a long tramp through the woods. He had
strapped over his shoulder a goodly sized box
of lunch, and the cavalcade started cheerfully
down the walk that led toward the forest, a compact
mass of foliage lying to the left of them.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this fun?‚Äù demanded Jimmie. ‚ÄúI feel
just in the humor for a lark.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI hope you can climb fences, girls,‚Äù called
Stephen over his shoulder, as he trudged along,
ahead of the others.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe could even climb a tree if we had to,‚Äù
answered Bab, ‚Äúor swim a creek.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOr ride a horse bareback,‚Äù interrupted Jimmie,
who had heard the story of Bab‚Äôs escapade
on the road to Newport.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is the end of uncle‚Äôs land,‚Äù said
Stephen, at last. ‚ÄúWe now find ourselves entering
the black forest. Here‚Äôs the trail,‚Äù he
called as the others helped the two girls over
the dividing fence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll right, Scout Stephen,‚Äù replied Jimmie.
‚ÄúWe are following close behind. Proceed with
the march.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, there was a distinct road leading
straight into the forest, formed by ruts from
cartwheels, probably the carts of the woodcutters,
Stephen explained. The edges of the wood
were rather thin and scant, like the meagre
fringe on a man‚Äôs head just beginning to turn
bald at the temples; but as they marched deeper
into the forest, the trees grew so thickly that
their branches overhead formed a canopy like
a roof. Squirrels and chipmunks scampered
across their path and occasionally a rabbit could
be seen scurrying through the underbrush.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this great!‚Äù exclaimed Stephen, after
they had been walking for some time. ‚ÄúUncle
says there‚Äôs scarcely such another wood in this
part of the country.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak so loud, Stephen,‚Äù said Jimmie.
‚ÄúIt is so quiet here, I feel as if we would wake
something, if we spoke above a whisper.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wake the echoes,‚Äù replied Stephen and
he gave a yodel familiar to all boys, a sort of
trilling in the head and throat that is melodious
in sound and carries further than an ordinary
call. Immediately there was an answer to the
yodel. It might have seemed an echo, only there
was no place for an echo in this shut-in spot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
They all stopped and listened as the answer
died away among the branches of the trees.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCurious,‚Äù said Jimmie. ‚ÄúIt was rather
close, too. Perhaps one of your woodcutters
is playing a trick on us, Stephen. Suppose we
try again, and see what happens!‚Äù Jimmie
gave another yodel, louder and longer than the
first. As they paused and listened, the answer
came again like an echo, this time even nearer.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs investigate,‚Äù proposed Alfred. ‚ÄúI
think it came from over there,‚Äù and he led the
way through the trees toward the echo.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHalloo-o,‚Äù he called, ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù and
the answer came back ‚ÄúHalloo-o, who are you?‚Äù
followed by a mocking laugh.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, after all, it isn‚Äôt any of our business
who you are,‚Äù cried Stephen, exasperated, ‚Äúand
I don‚Äôt think we had better leave the trail just
here for a fellow who is afraid to come out and
show himself,‚Äù he added in a lower tone.
</p>
<p>
There was no reply and they returned to the
cartwheel road and began the march again.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou were quite right, Stephen,‚Äù said Ruth,
‚Äúwhy should we waste our time over an idler
who plays tricks on people?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was another laugh, which seemed to
come from high up in the branches; then
sounds like the chattering of squirrels, followed
by low whistles and bird calls. They examined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
the branches of the trees around them, but there
was nothing in sight.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, go along!‚Äù exclaimed Alfred angrily.
‚ÄúOnly cowards hide behind trees. Brave men
show themselves.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Silence greeted this sally, also, and they
trudged on through the forest without any
further effort to see the annoyer. Several
times acorn shells whizzed past their heads, and
once Jimmie made a running jump, thinking he
saw some one behind a tree, but returned crestfallen.
A surprise was in store for them, however.
They had been walking for some time
when the trail, which hitherto had run straight
through the middle of the wood, gave a sudden
and unexpected turn, to avoid a depression in
the land, overgrown with vines and small trees,
and now dry from the drought.
</p>
<p>
They paused a moment on the curve of the
path to look across at the graceful little hollow
which seemed to be the meeting place of slender
young pine trees and silver birches gleaming
white among the dark green branches.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow like people they look,‚Äù Bab whispered.
She never knew just why she did so. ‚ÄúLike
girls in white dresses at a party.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the pine trees are the men,‚Äù whispered
Jimmie. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said excitedly, under his
breath, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a man! Perhaps it‚Äôs the‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
He stopped short and his voice died away in
amazement. Barbara said ‚ÄúSh-h-h!‚Äù and the
others paused in wonder. Just emerging from
the hollow on the other side, was the figure of
a man. All eyes saw him at the same moment
and two pairs of eyes at least recognized a green
velveteen hunting suit. As the figure turned for
one brief instant and scanned the forest they
saw his face in a flash.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jos√©!‚Äù they gasped.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, ‚Äúhe is wearing the
green velveteens!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI know it,‚Äù replied her friend. ‚ÄúBut are we
sure it was Jos√©?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo; we aren‚Äôt sure,‚Äù answered Stephen.
‚ÄúIt certainly looked like Jos√©, but we‚Äôll give him
the benefit of the doubt, at any rate.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
From beyond the hollow came another yodel.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBy Jove!‚Äù said Jimmie, ‚Äúnothing but a
tricky foreigner, after all, and I was just beginning
to like him too.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs more than a trickster,‚Äù Bab whispered.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wearing a green velveteen suit.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, what of it?‚Äù asked Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same suit the highwayman wore
who slashed the tires of the automobile.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhew-w-w!‚Äù cried the boys.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBe careful,‚Äù whispered Ruth. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let
him hear us. Do you think he saw us?‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied Alfred, ‚Äúor he would never
have yodeled.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Barbara began to consider. Should she tell
about the knife, or should she wait? She believed
that if she told it would only complicate
matters and bring Zerlina, the Gypsy girl, into
the muddle. Suppose she told, and then, when
they reached home, they found that Jos√© had
been away that morning? It would immediately
call down upon him the suspicions of the
whole party, suspicions perhaps undeserved.
Bab had never had cause to regret her ability
to keep a secret, and she concluded to test it
again by holding her peace a little longer.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√© or no Jos√©, let‚Äôs go on and have our
good time,‚Äù exclaimed Stephen. ‚ÄúEverything
depends on whether Jos√© was at home or not this
morning. If he wasn‚Äôt, why, then he‚Äôll have to
give an account of himself. And if he was, we
shall have to consult uncle about what to do.
We will hunt the man out of these woods, anyway.
He has no business lurking around
here.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Once more they started off, and were not
troubled again by the yodler.
</p>
<p>
Presently the jangle of a bell was heard in
the distance, a pleasant musical tinkle in the
midst of the green stillness of the forest.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat on earth is <em>that</em>?‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
little nervous now from the nearness of the
robber.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf I am not mistaken,‚Äù replied Stephen,
‚Äúthat is old Adam, the woodcutter. He has been
living in these woods all his life, seventy years
or more. He looks almost like a tree himself,
he is so gnarled and weather-beaten and bent.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In a few moments the woodman‚Äôs cart hove
into sight, drawn by a bony old horse from
whose collar jangled the little bell. The cart
was loaded with bundles of wood, and Adam
walked at the side holding the rope lines in one
hand and flourishing a whip in the other, the
lash of which he carefully kept away from his
horse, which was ambling along at its pleasure.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGood day, Adam,‚Äù said Stephen. ‚ÄúHow
are you, and how is the wood business?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs Mr. Stephen!‚Äù cried the old man,
touching his cap with one of his knotted hands.
‚ÄúThe wood business is good, sir. We manage
to live, my wife and I. Although I‚Äôm wishin‚Äô
t‚Äôwas something else kept us going. I never
fell a tree, sir, I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm killin‚Äô something
alive. They are fine old trees,‚Äù he went on,
patting the bark of a silver birch affectionately.
‚ÄúI would not kill one of these white ladies, sir,
if you was to pay me a hundred dollars!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame, Adam,‚Äù replied Stephen. ‚ÄúIt
must be like cutting down your own family, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
have lived among them for so many years. How
is the hermit? Do you give him enough wood
to keep him alive in the winter?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not been himself of late,‚Äù answered
Adam, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always
strange at this time of the year.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôll see us if we go over?‚Äù
asked Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think so, sir,‚Äù replied Adam. ‚ÄúNo matter
how bad off he is, he‚Äôs always kind. I never
see him angry.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, good-bye, Adam, and good luck to
you,‚Äù said Stephen, dropping a piece of money
into the wrinkled palm, and they continued their
journey through the wood.
</p>
<p>
The little bell resumed its tinkle, and the cart
was soon out of sight.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV‚ÄîTHE HERMIT</h2>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you know,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, ‚ÄúI feel
as if I were in an enchanted forest,
and these strange people were witches
and wizards! The robber might have been a
wood-elf, and now here comes the old witch.
Perhaps she will turn us into trees and animals.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, that is old Jennie, who gathers herbs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
and sells them at all the drugstores in the towns
around here,‚Äù replied Stephen, as a strange figure
came into view.
</p>
<p>
The gatherer of herbs and roots was not,
however, very witchlike in appearance. She
was tall and erect, and walked with long strides
like a grenadier. What was most remarkable
about her were her wide, staring blue eyes, like
patches of sky, that looked far beyond the young
people who had grouped themselves at the side
of the path almost timidly, waiting for her to
come up. She carried with her a staff, and as
she walked she poked the bushes and grasses
with it as if it had been a long finger feeling for
trophies. The other hand grasped the end of
an apron made of an old sack, stuffed full of
herbs still green, and fragrant from having been
bruised as she crushed them into the bag.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShe is blind,‚Äù whispered Stephen, ‚Äúbut in a
minute she will perceive that some one is near.
She has a scent as keen as a hunting dog‚Äôs.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
A few yards away from them old Jennie
paused and sniffed the air like an animal.
Reaching out with her stick she felt around her.
Presently the staff pointed in the direction of
the boys and girls, and she came toward them
as straight as a hunter after his quarry. The
girls, a little frightened, started to draw back.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt hurt you,‚Äù whispered Stephen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
‚ÄúWhy, Jennie,‚Äù he said in a louder voice,
‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know your old friend and playmate?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
A smile broke out on Jennie‚Äôs handsome face,
which, in spite of her age, was as smooth and
placid as a child‚Äôs.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Master Stephen!‚Äù she cried, in a strange
voice that sounded rusty from lack of use. ‚ÄúI
be glad to hear you, sir. It‚Äôs a long time since
we‚Äôve had a frolic in the woods. You don‚Äôt hunt
birds‚Äô nests in the summer now, or go wading in
the streams. I found a wasps‚Äô nest for you,
perhaps it was a month, perhaps a year ago, I
cannot remember. But I saved it for you. And
how is young Master Martin? He was a little
fellow to climb so high for the nests.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe are both well, Jennie, and you must come
over to the hall and see us. We may have something
nice for you, there, that will keep you
warm when the snow comes.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôre a good boy, Master Stephen, and
I‚Äôll bid ye good day now, and good day to your
friends. There be four with you I think,‚Äù she
added in a lower voice, sniffing the air again.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be over on my next trip to the village.‚Äù
Old Jennie moved off as swiftly as she had come,
tapping the path with her long stick, her head
thrown back as if to see with her nostrils, since
her eyes were without sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat a strange old woman!‚Äù cried
Stephen‚Äôs companions in one voice.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the strangest thing about her,‚Äù replied
Stephen, ‚Äúis that she has no sense of time. She
can‚Äôt remember whether a thing happened a
year ago or month ago, and she thinks Martin
and I are still little boys. We haven‚Äôt hunted
birds‚Äô nests with her for six years. I have not
even seen her for two or three years, but she
sniffed me out as quickly as if I always used
triple extract of tuberose.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhere does she live?‚Äù asked Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShe lives in a little cabin off in the forest
somewhere. Her father and mother were woodcutters.
She was born and brought up right
here. She doesn‚Äôt know anything but herbs and
roots, and night and day are the same to her.
She knows every square foot of this country, and
never gets lost. Martin and I used to go about
with her when we were little boys, and she was
as faithful a nurse as you could possibly find.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo wonder you love these woods, Stephen,‚Äù
said Bab. ‚ÄúThere is so much to do and see in
them. I wish we had something better than
scrub oak around Kingsbridge.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait until you see the chief treasure of the
woods, Barbara, and you‚Äôll have even more respect
for them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMeaning the hermit?‚Äù asked Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut he won‚Äôt tell anything, will he?‚Äù demanded
Ruth. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say he was a mystery?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe greatest mystery of the countryside,‚Äù
replied Stephen. ‚ÄúNobody knows where he
came from, nor why he has been living here all
these years‚Äîit‚Äôs about fifty, they say. You see,
he is not ignorant, like the other wood people.
He is a gentleman. His manners are as fine as
uncle‚Äôs, and the people who live in the woods
all love him. They come to him when they are
sick or in trouble.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow does he live?‚Äù asked Alfred.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe must have some money hidden away
somewhere, for he always has enough to eat, and
even to give when others need help. But nobody
knows where he keeps it. In a hole in the
ground somewhere, I suppose.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
While they were talking they had approached
a clearing on the side of a hill. Most of the big
trees had been cut away, and only the silver birch,
‚Äúthe white ladies,‚Äù as old Adam had christened
them, and the dogwood, mingled their shade
over the smooth turf. The grass was as thick
and well kept as on the major‚Äôs lawn, only
somewhat browned now for lack of water. All
the bushes and undergrowth had been cleared
away years before, and the place had a lived-in,
homelike look in contrast to the great black forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
that seemed to be crouching at its feet like
a monster guarding it from the enemy. And
indeed, that must have been what the mysterious
man had intended when he built his little house
at the top of the hill, for five miles of woods intervened
between him and the outer world on
one side, while on the other, was a high precipice
that marked the end of the forest.
</p>
<p>
The house, a log cabin with a big stone chimney
at one end, commanded a view, from the
back, of a long stretch of valley. The portico in
front was shaded by honeysuckle vines. Here,
in an old-fashioned armchair, sat the master
smoking a meerschaum pipe.
</p>
<p>
Stephen approached somewhat diffidently, taking
off his cap.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMay we rest here a little, sir?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúWe have walked a long way this morning.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are most welcome,‚Äù said the old man
in a deep, musical voice that gave the young people
a thrill of pleasure. They looked at him
curiously. He was tall and erect, with a beak-nose
and black eyes that still had some of their
youthful fire in them, despite the man‚Äôs great
age and his snow white hair.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome in, and we will bring some chairs out
for the young ladies.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Stephen followed their host into the house
while, through the open door, the others caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
a glimpse of an enormous open fireplace and
walls lined with books. The girls took the
proffered chairs and sat down rather stiffly,
while the old man reappeared, carrying a bucket
and a gourd.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps you are thirsty. Will you draw
some water from the well?‚Äù he asked, turning
to Stephen. He stopped abruptly and looked
closely at the boy. ‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs little Stephen,‚Äù
he exclaimed, and with an expression half of
pain, half pleasure, he added, ‚Äúgrown to be a
man and how like‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄîBut he paused and
turned hastily away.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am glad to see you, sir,‚Äù replied Stephen,
politely. He never knew exactly how to address
the hermit, and he found not knowing his name
somewhat awkward. ‚ÄúMay I introduce my
friends? Miss Ruth Stuart, Miss Barbara
Thurston, Alfred Marsdale and Jimmie Butler.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The old man bowed to the company as gracefully
as if he had been receiving guests in a fine
mansion.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe names are,‚Äù he repeated gently, ‚ÄúMiss
Ruth Stuart and‚Äîdid I hear you aright‚ÄîMiss‚Äî‚Äî?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBarbara Thurston,‚Äù finished Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBarbara Thurston?‚Äù repeated the old man
under his breath. ‚ÄúBarbara Thurston! Come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
here, my child, and let me look at you,‚Äù he
added, in an agitated voice.
</p>
<p>
Barbara obediently came forward and stood
before the hermit, who had covered his eyes
with his hand for a moment, as if he were afraid
to see her face.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBarbara Thurston!‚Äù he exclaimed again.
‚ÄúLittle Barbara!‚Äù And drawing from his
pocket a pair of horn spectacles, he put them
on and examined her features. He seemed to
have forgotten the others. Suddenly he removed
the spectacles and looked up in a dazed
way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOn the very day! The very day!‚Äù he cried,
and waving his arms over his head in a wild
appeal to heaven, he turned and rushed down
the hillside. In another moment the forest had
swallowed him up, while the five young people
stood staring after him in amazement.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, of all the rummy old chaps!‚Äù exclaimed
Alfred.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs touched of course,‚Äù said Stephen,
tapping his head. ‚ÄúHe must be. You know
old Adam said he‚Äôs always pretty bad at this
time of the year. I suppose it is the anniversary
of something. But, Barbara, what do you mean
by going and stirring up memories?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt I; it was my name,‚Äù replied Barbara.
‚ÄúOnce there was a girl named Barbara,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
but the rest of the story can never be written,
because he won‚Äôt tell what it is.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a peep at the house before we
go,‚Äù said Jimmie, ‚Äúand then let‚Äôs eat. I‚Äôm
starving.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Stephen. ‚ÄúStep right in
and have a look for yourselves, but hurry up
before the old gentleman comes back.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The place was certainly comfortable and cosy-looking,
in spite of the wooden walls and bare
floors. It was spick and span and clean, kept
that way by Adam‚Äôs wife, Stephen explained.
There were a great many books, some of them
in foreign languages, two big easy-chairs near
the open fireplace, and on an old mahogany table,
the only other piece of furniture in the room,
a brown earthenware jar filled with honeysuckle.
Only one picture hung on the wall, a
small miniature suspended from a nail just over
the pot of flowers. Ruth examined the picture
closely. Besides his books, she thought, this little
miniature was perhaps the only link with the
outer world that the old man had permitted himself
to keep.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome here, everybody, quick,‚Äù she called,
‚Äúand look at this miniature. As I live, it‚Äôs
enough like Bab to be a picture of her, except
for the old-fashioned dress and long ringlets.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They looked at the picture carefully, taking it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
down from its nail in order to see it in the
light.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy word!‚Äù exclaimed Jimmie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as
good a likeness as you could wish to find. It
must have been the resemblance that gave the
old man the fit, then, and not the name.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The miniature showed the face of a young
girl, somewhat older than Barbara, but certainly
very like her in features and expression. She
had the same laughing mouth and frank, brown
eyes, the same chestnut hair curling in crisp
ringlets around the forehead, but caught up
loosely in the back in a net and tied with a velvet
snood. She wore a bodice of rose-colored
taffeta cut low in the neck, and fastened coquettishly
among the curls was a pink flower.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWho is it, Barbara?‚Äù asked Stephen.
‚ÄúHave you any idea?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine,‚Äù replied Bab. ‚ÄúPerhaps
it‚Äôs just a coincidence. I am not an uncommon
type and may have lots of doubles. There
are many people in this world who have brown
eyes and brown hair. You meet them at every
turn.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Ruth, ‚Äúbut all of them haven‚Äôt
regular features and little crisp curls, and just
that particular expression. However, we must
go. We shouldn‚Äôt like the hermit to come back
and find us prying into his affairs. And that is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
why he is here, evidently‚Äîto hide from pryers.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù agreed Stephen, ‚ÄúI really do think we
had better be going. I know a pretty little dell
where we can eat lunch if Jimmie can restrain
his appetite until we get there.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, cut along, then,‚Äù ordered Jimmie,
‚Äúand let us hasten to the banquet hall.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Closing the door carefully behind them the
young folks hurried toward the woodcutters‚Äô
road.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI‚ÄîA SURPRISE</h2>
<p>
When the last sandwich had been eaten,
and the last crumb of cake disposed of,
the picnic party leaned lazily against
the moss-covered trunk of a fallen tree to discuss
the events of the morning.
</p>
<p>
Jos√© was the subject of the talk. All were inclined
to believe, now, that they had been deceived
by the strong resemblance between the
young Spaniard and the mischievous person who
had mystified them in the woods that morning. It
seemed impossible that Jos√© was a thief, or that
he could have been guilty of such trifling trickery
as the individual in the robber‚Äôs clothes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
Jos√©, quiet and reserved though he was, had
become a favorite with the young people.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is strange,‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúHe must have
the nameless charm, because there is not one of
us who does not like him. As for me, I feel
sorry for him. And why, I‚Äôd like to know?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his mournful black eye, my dear young
lady,‚Äù replied Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhatever it is,‚Äù said Stephen, decisively,
‚Äúwe must not make any accusations without
knowing, for certain, that we are right. It is
rather an uncomfortable situation, I think, considering
he is uncle‚Äôs guest.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is, indeed,‚Äù replied Alfred, ‚Äúand I vote
that we say not a word to anyone until we find
out where Jos√© spent the morning.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAgreed by all,‚Äù cried Jimmie. ‚ÄúAm I
right, girls?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The two girls assented, and the matter was
settled.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think we had better be moving on toward
home, now,‚Äù said Stephen, ‚Äúif we want to escape
a scolding from Miss Stuart.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll right, general,‚Äù replied Jimmie. ‚ÄúThe
bivouac is at an end. Rise, soldiers, and follow
your leader.‚Äù He cocked his hat, turned
up his coat collar and struck a Napoleon
pose.
</p>
<p>
There was a stifled laugh, from behind a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
clump of alder bushes‚Äîa coarse laugh that made
the boys look up quickly and uneasily.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù asked Ruth, frightened.
</p>
<p>
Without waiting for a reply, Alfred divided
the bushes with his cane disclosing three pairs
of eyes gazing impudently at them. Three figures
untangled themselves from the bushes and
rose stiffly, as if they had been lying concealed
there for a long time. The girls gave a stifled
cry of alarm, for each recognized the giant
tramp, who had attacked them near the churchyard
of Sleepy Hollow; and his companions
were probably the same, although the girls had
not seen them at that time. The leader of the
three roughs did not recognize them, however.
He had been too much intoxicated to remember
their faces; but he was sober, now, and in an
uglier mood than when he had been in his cups.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo ho!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúWe have here five
rich, young persons‚Äîrich with the money they
have no right to‚Äîstolen money‚Äîstolen from me
and mine. While we beg and tramp, and dress
in rags, you throw away the money we have
earned for you. Well, we won‚Äôt have it. Will
we, pals? We‚Äôll get back some of the money
that belongs to us by rights. You‚Äôll hand out
what you‚Äôve got in your pockets, and, if it ain‚Äôt
enough, we‚Äôll keep you into the bargain until
your fathers they pays for your release. D‚Äôye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
see? Ho! Ho!‚Äù He roared out a terrible
laugh until the woods resounded.
</p>
<p>
The three boys had lined up in front of the
two girls and Stephen had called to them reassuringly
over his shoulder:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStart on, girls. You know the path. Follow
it the way we came. If you meet Adam,
ask him to go with you, or even old Jennie.
Don‚Äôt be frightened. It‚Äôll be all right, but
we‚Äôve got to fight.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Barbara and Ruth, both very calm and pale,
were standing silently, waiting for orders.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you think we could help by staying,
Bab?‚Äù asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, dear,‚Äù replied Bab. ‚ÄúWait,
and let me think a moment.‚Äù She closed her eyes
and her moving lips repeated the little prayer:
‚ÄúHeaven, make me calm in the face of danger,‚Äù
but in that moment the fight had begun. The
two girls stood fascinated, rooted to the spot.
</p>
<p>
Stephen, who was a trained boxer, had tackled
the leader and had managed to give him several
straight blows, at the same time dodging the
badly-aimed blows from the big fist of his opponent.
Alfred had purposely chosen the next
largest tramp, leaving a small, wiry man for
Jimmie to grapple with. Alfred, also, had been
carefully trained in the arts of boxing and wrestling;
but his opponent was no mean match for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
him, and the two presently were rolling over
and over on the ground, their faces covered with
dust and blood. Poor Jimmie was not a
fighter. All his life he had shunned gymnasiums,
preferring to thrum the piano or the
guitar, or invent models for airships. However,
the boy was no coward and he went at his
enemy with a will that was lacking in force only
because he himself lacked the muscle to give it.
But the wiry fellow who had been his portion
was evidently the best-trained fighter of the
three tramps, and it was only a few moments
before Jimmie was bleeding from the nose and
one eye was blacked. It looked as if Alfred,
too, were getting the worst of it, while Stephen
and his tramp were still raining blows upon each
other, jumping about in a circle. Bab longed to
help Jimmie, but she saw, and Ruth agreed, that
they would do more harm than good.
</p>
<p>
The two girls decided to run for help, even if
they had to run all the way to Ten Eyck
Hall, especially as, in the midst of the scrimmage,
Stephen had called out to them to hurry
up.
</p>
<p>
Making the best speed they could through the
brambles and ferns, they had gone not more than
a few rods when, pausing in their flight, they
found themselves face to face with blind Jennie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat is happening?‚Äù demanded the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
woman in a terrified whisper. ‚ÄúI hear the
sound of blows. I smell blood.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere is a fight, Jennie,‚Äù replied Bab, almost
sobbing in her excitement. ‚ÄúWe must get
help quickly from somewhere. Are the Gypsies
far from here?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answered Jennie. ‚ÄúNot so near as
the hall. But wait! Come with me,‚Äù and her
face was illumined by the expression of one who
is about to reveal a well-kept secret.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, Jennie, is it help you are bringing us?‚Äù
asked Ruth, demurring a little.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou may trust old Jennie,‚Äù exclaimed the
blind woman. ‚ÄúBe ye not the friends of young
Master Stephen?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The two girls followed without a word.
</p>
<p>
Almost in sight of the fighters, she paused
by the stump of a hollow tree which, when
rolled away by her strong arm, disclosed a sort
of trapdoor underneath. Lifting the door,
crudely constructed with strips of wood, the bark
still on, the girls saw a small underground
chamber dug out like a cellar. The walls were
shored up with split trees which also did duty
as cross beams. There was a rough, hand-made
ladder at the opening, and at one side a shelf on
which was neatly folded‚Äîcould they believe
their eyes‚Äîthe suit of green velveteen. Old
Jennie, who seemed to be peering down into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
cavity with her sightless blue eyes, shook Bab‚Äôs
arm impatiently.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGet the firearms,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey
be on the shelf. I felt them there last time.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, lying in the shadow at the far
end of the shelf the girls made out two pistols
gleaming ominously in the dark. Without a
word, Bab bounded down the ladder, and seizing
the pistols was up again almost as quickly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhave you forgotten our
rifle practice in the Berkshires?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied her friend. ‚ÄúAll you have to
do is to cock it and pull the trigger, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù answered Bab. ‚ÄúTake this
one and come on. They are both loaded, I see.
Don‚Äôt fire unless I tell you, and be careful where
you aim. You had better point up so as not to
hit anybody. Jennie, wait for us over here. I
believe you have saved us all.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
So saying, Bab ran, followed by Ruth, to the
scene of the battle. And it was indeed a battle!
Jimmie was lying insensible on the ground,
while his opponent had joined in the fight
against Stephen, who was rapidly losing
strength. Alfred and his tramp were still rolling
over and over, locked in each other‚Äôs arms.
</p>
<p>
A few feet away from the fighters Bab fired
her pistol in the air. The explosion stopped the
fight. So intent had the combatants been that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
they had forgotten time and place. At the report
of the pistol they came to themselves almost
with a jump. Everybody, except poor, unconscious
Jimmie, paused breathless, perspiration
pouring from their faces. Alfred had got the
better of his opponent and his hands gripped
the man‚Äôs throat. Bab, followed by Ruth,
dashed up, and both girls pointed their pistols at
the two tramps who were engaging Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúShall we shoot them, Stephen?‚Äù asked Bab
as calmly as if nothing had happened.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThrow up your hands,‚Äù cried Stephen to
the tramps; which they proceeded to do in
prompt order. ‚ÄúNow, give me your pistol,
Ruth; give yours to Alfred, Bab.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Alfred had risen, hardly
recognizable in a coating of dust and blood, ordering
his man to lie quiet or be killed.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSuppose we herd them together, Stephen,‚Äù
he suggested, ‚Äúand drive them up to the hall like
the cattle they are?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJust what I was thinking,‚Äù replied Stephen,
‚Äúonly what about Jimmie?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe girls will see to him,‚Äù answered Alfred.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù retorted Stephen. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt
leave the girls here alone with him in that condition,
not after this. There may be more
tramps lurking around, for all we know.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Just then an exclamation from Ruth, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
kneeling beside the prostrate Jimmie, caused
the two boys to turn their heads involuntarily,
and in that moment, the two men who were
standing with their arms up at the point of
Stephen‚Äôs pistol, ran for the underbrush,
Stephen shot and missed his aim. He shot
again and hit the small fellow in the leg, having
aimed low; not wishing to kill even in self-defense.
But the tramps had plunged into the
woods, and were out of sight in an instant.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBetter not go after them, Stephen,‚Äù called
Alfred. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got one here and we may
catch the others later. I wish we had a rope to
tie this fellow‚Äôs hands with.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTry this,‚Äù suggested Ruth, and she calmly
tore the muslin ruffle off her petticoat and
handed the strip to Alfred, who bound the man‚Äôs
hands behind his back and ordered him to sit
still until he was wanted.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the two girls had turned their attention
to Jimmie, who showed no signs of returning
consciousness, but lay battered and
bleeding, a sad sight in comparison to the joyous
Jimmie of half an hour before. Blind Jennie
had come from her hiding place behind a tree,
and was kneeling beside the wounded boy.
Feeling the abrasions on his face with her sensitive
fingers, she shuddered.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe should have water,‚Äù she whispered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
‚ÄúThere is a brook not far from here. I will
show you,‚Äù and she turned her sightless eyes
in the direction of Stephen, who was guarding
the remaining tramp.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRuth, you and Alfred take our three hats
and go with Jennie for the water. Alfred,
take the pistol with you in case of another attack.
Bab, you stay and look after Jimmie,
please.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Alfred followed after old Jennie,
while Bab, kneeling beside Jimmie, began chafing
his wrists. Not a sound broke the stillness.
Stephen, on a log, had his pistol cocked and
pointed straight at the tramp who was huddled
in a heap on the ground, gazing sullenly into the
barrel of the pistol. Bab had not looked around
for some time, so intent was she on her efforts to
bring some life back into poor Jimmie. But
feeling a sudden, unaccountable loneliness, she
called:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen, aren‚Äôt you curious to know where
we found the pistols?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was no answer, and, looking over her
shoulder, Bab was horrified to see Stephen lying
prone on the ground in a dead faint, the pistol
still grasped tightly in his hand, while the tramp
had evidently lost no time in joining his pals.
</p>
<p>
Leaving Jimmie, Bab rushed to Stephen.
First releasing the pistol from his hand, she laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
it on a stump. Then she began rubbing his
wrists and temples.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPoor old Stephen!‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúYou
were hurt all the time and never said a word.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Slowly he opened his eyes and looked at Bab
in a sort of shamefaced way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI suppose the tramp got away?‚Äù he asked.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWho cares,‚Äù replied his friend, ‚Äúif you
aren‚Äôt hurt?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúI was only
winded. That big fellow gave me a blow, just
as you shot the pistol off, that nearly did for me.
But I thought I could keep up until the others
came back. I knew I couldn‚Äôt go for the water.
How did you get the pistols?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
By the time Bab had finished her story the
others had come up with the water.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just as well the tramp has gone,‚Äù said
Alfred, when he had heard what had happened.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe we could have managed him
and Jimmie, too.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They bathed Jimmie‚Äôs face and wrists with
the cold spring water, and it was a battered and
disconsolate young man who finally opened his
one good eye on the company.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Stephen, ‚Äúwe had better put
these pistols back where they were. If they are
gone, the robber will take alarm and we‚Äôll never
catch him. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be attacked by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
those tramps any more to-day. They‚Äôll never
imagine we have left the pistols.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The others agreed, and the pistols were left
on the shelf by Bab, who remembered exactly
where they had been when she found them. All
the others, even Jimmie, peered curiously down
into the underground room.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been very long dug,‚Äù observed
Alfred. ‚ÄúThere is so much fresh earth
around the door. The fellow carted most of it
away, I suppose, and put leaves and sticks over
what was left. But there is plenty of evidence
of fresh earth, just the same.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo there is,‚Äù replied Stephen. ‚ÄúJennie, you
did a good day‚Äôs work when you found that hole
in the ground. You may have saved our lives,
for all we can tell.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But the old woman only muttered, as she
punched the leaves with her staff. The somewhat
dilapidated picnic party resumed its homeward
journey, Jimmie supported by his two
friends and stopping often to rest, while the two
girls followed, keeping a sharp lookout on both
sides. Old Jennie brought up the rear.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII‚ÄîZERLINA</h2>
<p>
When they reached Ten Eyck Hall, it
was with relief that the young people
learned that the others had gone motoring
for the afternoon, and would probably
not be back until dinner time. Stephen put Jimmie
under the care of the housekeeper, who
bound up his wounds in absorbent cotton saturated
with witch hazel. The girls disappeared
into their own room, but not before Bab had
cautioned Stephen to bring them word about
Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
The information came in the form of a few
scribbled lines on the tea tray.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJohn tells me,‚Äù the note ran, ‚Äúthat Jos√©
was off on his motor cycle until lunch time. S.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The two girls read the note excitedly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab, dear,‚Äù cried Ruth, ‚ÄúI simply can‚Äôt believe
it of that nice boy, can you?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to believe it,‚Äù replied Bab,
‚Äúeven though appearances are against him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut who could the joker in the woods have
been, if not Jos√©?‚Äù continued Ruth. ‚ÄúAnd,
come to think of it, he might have been the highwayman,
too. It would not have been difficult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
for him to have found out at the hotel where
we were going. I am afraid he is in an awful
mess, yet, in spite of everything, there is something
about him that disarms suspicion.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Ruth was a loyal friend to people she liked.
She believed that her chosen circle consisted of
a superior class of beings, and she was as blind
to their faults as a mother to those of her favorite
child. There was a tap on the door, and the
maid informed them that Zerlina, the Gypsy
girl, wished to speak to them.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSend her up,‚Äù said Ruth, and presently
Zerlina was ushered into the room.
</p>
<p>
There was a scared look in her eyes as they
wandered hastily around the charming apartment
and finally rested on the two girls who were
stretched on the bed in muslin kimonos.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow do you do, Zerlina?‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúExcuse
our not getting up. We are just dead
tired. Won‚Äôt you have a cup of tea?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù replied the Gypsy stiffly, ‚ÄúI
do not care for tea. I came‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù she paused.
‚ÄúI thought‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù she hesitated again.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, Zerlina, what did you think?‚Äù asked
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Bab was looking at the girl curiously.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI came because you asked me,‚Äù she said
finally.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo we did,‚Äù replied Ruth, ‚Äúand we are delighted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
see you. Did your grandmother come
with you?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù answered Zerlina and paused again.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps you had some special reason for
coming, Zerlina,‚Äù hinted Bab. ‚ÄúWas it to ask
us a question?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girl‚Äôs face took on the same stubborn expression
it had worn when Bab had asked her
to show the knife used in the dance.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI came because you asked me,‚Äù she repeated,
in the same sing-song tone.
</p>
<p>
Again there was a tap at the door and
Bridget appeared, bringing a note for Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnother note from Stephen,‚Äù observed
Bab, reading it carefully and handing it to Ruth.
The note said:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf you and Ruth don‚Äôt mind, kindly keep
the fight, if possible, a secret from everybody
for a day or two. It would be necessary to explain
about the pistols, and if Jos√© is the man
who owns them, telling would give everything
away. I shall tell uncle, of course. People will
think that Jimmie fell out of a tree or down into
a hollow. Keep as quiet as possible about the
particulars of our adventure. S.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth; ‚Äúit would have
been such fun to tell it all.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe telling is only a pleasure deferred for a
while,‚Äù said her friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the Gypsy girl had lost nothing
of the conversation except the contents of
the note, which Bab had rolled into a little ball
and thrown into a waste paper basket.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWill the ladies not show me some of their
beautiful dresses?‚Äù asked Zerlina presently.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt much to show,‚Äù replied Ruth,
‚Äúbut we‚Äôll be glad to show what we have.‚Äù She
pulled herself lazily from the bed and opened
the door of a wardrobe at one side of the room.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRuth, you show her your fine things,‚Äù
called Bab. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt a rag worth seeing.
Get out your pink lingerie and your leghorn with
the shaded roses. They would please her eye.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you show her your organdie,
Bab?‚Äù asked Ruth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just as pretty as my
pink, any day.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, very well,‚Äù returned Bab, opening her
side of the massive clothes press and spreading
the dress on the bed before the admiring eyes
of Zerlina. ‚Äú‚ÄòA poor thing, but mine own,‚Äô‚Äù
she said. ‚ÄúI certainly never thought to be displaying
my rich wardrobe to anyone. It‚Äôs entirely
a new sensation.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Ruth had piled her own
gauzy finery on the bed beside Bab‚Äôs, and Zerlina
feasted her gaze on the pink lace-trimmed
princess dresses and the flower bedecked hats.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSome day you must have pretty dresses, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
Zerlina,‚Äù said Ruth from the depths of the
wardrobe, as she replaced the things; ‚Äúsome day
when you are a great singer.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was no reply, and Bab, who was busy
folding her dress, looked quickly around. Zerlina‚Äôs
arm was in the scrap basket. She had
looked up as Ruth spoke, and catching Bab‚Äôs
eye, dropped the crumpled note she had just
seized. An angry blush overspread her face
and she bit her lip in embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI must be going,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is late.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Bab did not answer. She was thinking
deeply. Here was positive proof that Zerlina
and Jos√© were working together in some way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait a minute, Zerlina,‚Äù called Ruth, kindly.
‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you accept this red velvet bow? It
would look pretty in your black hair.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù exclaimed the girl, her eyes
filling with tears. ‚ÄúYou are very good to me.‚Äù
Her lip trembled as if she were about to burst
into tears, but she conquered them with an effort
and started to the door. ‚ÄúGood-bye,‚Äù she
said, looking at Bab so reproachfully that the
latter‚Äôs heart was melted to pity.
</p>
<p>
At dinner that night there was much concern
expressed for poor Jimmie who, with his
face swathed in bandages, was sound asleep in
his own room. Stephen had been closeted with
his uncle for half an hour before the gong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
sounded, and the major‚Äôs usually placid face was
haunted by an expression of deep worry.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo tell us about the hermit, Stephen,‚Äù cried
Grace, and that being a safe subject the four adventurers
plunged into a description of the
strange old man and the miniature that so resembled
Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you remember when he came, Major?‚Äù
asked Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOnly vaguely,‚Äù replied the major, ‚ÄúI was
quite a little chap then, eight or ten, I think I
was, and we were living in France at the time.
He had become a fixture when we came back,
but he always shunned advances from my family.
Undoubtedly he was a fugitive from somewhere.
However, this is not such an out-of-the-way
place but that he could have been found if
they had looked for him very hard. I have not
seen him for many years. How does he look?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLike an exiled prince,‚Äù answered Ruth.
‚ÄúHe is a very noble looking old man.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√©, did you play croquet with the girls this
morning?‚Äù asked Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt he mean?‚Äù interrupted Mollie. ‚ÄúNo
sooner had you gone than he was off on his motor
cycle.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The young Spaniard‚Äôs face had flushed scarlet
at the question, but he smiled at Mollie‚Äôs teasing
reply and looked Stephen squarely in the eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt must have been rather hot work motoring
this morning, wasn‚Äôt it, Jos√©?‚Äù went on Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI went only to the forest,‚Äù answered Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
The four friends stirred uneasily, and the
major looked down at his plate. It hurt him
deeply to see Jos√© put on the rack in this way.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow far did you go into the woods, Jos√©?
It‚Äôs curious we didn‚Äôt meet you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOnly to the haunted pool,‚Äù replied Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou were not far off, then,‚Äù said Stephen.
‚ÄúDid you hear us yodeling?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù answered Jos√©; ‚Äúer‚Äîthat is, yes. I
did hear something like that, but I was not there
long.‚Äù His face was still flushed and he looked
as if he would like to run away from his inquisitors;
but the soft-hearted major could endure the
painful situation no longer and he changed the
conversation to another topic.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you young people ever dance?‚Äù
he asked. ‚ÄúI had planned to see young couples
whirling around the red drawing room. It
would be a pretty sight, Sallie. Would it not?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have a plan,‚Äù broke in Mollie, ‚Äúbut I can‚Äôt
tell it now. It‚Äôs to be a surprise for Miss Sallie
and the major.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear me!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie. ‚ÄúAre we
to feel honored or slighted, Major?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, not slighted,‚Äù protested Mollie. ‚ÄúIt is
something that will amuse you.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù asked a voice from the doorway.
‚ÄúI am palpitating to know.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Everybody looked up in surprise at the apparition
of Jimmie regarding the company
gravely with his one good eye. His other eye
was swathed in a bandage, and his nose was
swollen and red. There was a joyous peal of
laughter from the assembled party.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Jimmie,‚Äù cried Martin, ‚Äúyou look
like an exhausted Dutchman.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt throw stones, my son,‚Äù replied Jimmie.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Dutchman yourself, remember.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome in and have some dinner, Jimmie,‚Äù
coaxed the major.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôve dined, thank you, sir. My kind nurse
saw to that, and I feel considerably better.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow did you happen to black your eye, you
poor boy?‚Äù asked Mollie.
</p>
<p>
Stephen cleared his throat audibly. Why on
earth had he not cautioned Mollie not to ask
Jimmie any questions? But Ruth came to the
rescue and he breathed a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt ask Jimmie embarrassing questions,
Mollie. A black eye and a red nose are
enough to bear for the present.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The major relieved the situation by saying:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNow, Mistress Mollie, we are ready to be
surprised.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Stephen, taking Jimmie by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
the arm, and as they stood aside, he whispered
into his ear: ‚ÄúKeep it dark about the tramps.
Uncle will explain.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe surprise is this,‚Äù explained Mollie, detaining
the young people in the hall. ‚ÄúWhy not
give our masquerade to-night?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is as good a time as any other,‚Äù agreed
Martin.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, you children!‚Äù exclaimed Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a wet blanket, Stephen,‚Äù said
Martin.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I simply thought perhaps the girls might
be tired or something,‚Äù replied Stephen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll
all dress up if you like.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat fun!‚Äù cried Mollie. ‚ÄúJos√©, you‚Äôre to
be a pirate, remember.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think Jos√© would make a good highwayman,‚Äù
observed Bab, ‚Äúwith a knife in his belt
and a slouch hat on.‚Äù She had no sooner
spoken than she repented her words.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps I would, Mademoiselle,‚Äù he replied
gently, with a deep sigh.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII‚ÄîTHE MASQUERADE</h2>
<p>
The picture they made as they filed down
the oak staircase two by two and all attired
in their antique costumes was one
long remembered by the servants of Ten Eyck
Hall, who had gathered below to see the masqueraders.
Miss Stuart and the major, standing
together at the door of the red drawing room,
were amazed and delighted.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs this a company of ghosts,‚Äù cried the
major, ‚Äúghosts of my dear departed ancestors
returned to the halls of their youth?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLook at the dears!‚Äù exclaimed Miss Sallie.
‚ÄúHow pretty they are in their ancient finery!
Ruth, my child, you are the very image of the
portrait of your great-grandmother at home.
And here is Bab, who might have stepped out
of an old miniature.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo she has,‚Äù replied Ruth. ‚ÄúIn that pink
dress she is a perfect likeness of the miniature
the hermit had.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√©,‚Äù said the major kindly, for he could
not insult a guest by believing evil of him until
it had been actually proved, ‚Äúyou do not belong
to this company of belles and beaux. You look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
more like a Spanish gallant of an earlier day,
in that velvet coat and cavalier hat. As for you
two slips of girls,‚Äù he continued, smiling at Mollie
and Grace, ‚Äúyou might be my two colonial
great-aunts stepped down from their frames.
But come along, now. We must have a little
fun, after all this trouble you have taken to
amuse us. Strike up, my poor bruised Jimmie,
and we‚Äôll have a dance.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Jimmie had volunteered to furnish the music.
His face, in its present state, needed no further
disguise, he said. The furniture was moved
back, the rugs rolled up, and in a few minutes
the dancers were whirling in a waltz. There
was a change of partners at the second dance,
and Bab found herself dancing with Jos√©. He
was not familiar with the American two-step,
so, after a few rounds, they stepped out upon
the piazza for a breath of the cool evening air.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you afraid to stay out here, Jos√©,
after your experience of the other night?‚Äù Bab
asked.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAre you afraid, Barbara?‚Äù he replied.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy should I be?‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúIt was
evidently you the assassin was after.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
He winced at the word ‚Äúassassin,‚Äù and did
not reply. The two stood gazing silently out
onto the stretch of lawn in front of the house.
Presently Jos√© sighed deeply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am afraid you are unhappy,‚Äù said Bab
sympathetically.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMadamoiselle Barbara,‚Äù he replied, ‚ÄúI am
in great trouble. I tell you because you have
already been more observing than the others,
and because I see you keep your counsel.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you ask Major Ten Eyck‚Äôs advice,
Jos√©?‚Äù asked Barbara, ‚Äúhe is so kind
and gentle. I know he would love to help
you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIn this case,‚Äù replied the Spaniard, with a
frightened look in his eyes, ‚Äúhe might not be
so kind. I am afraid to tell him. To-night I
shall decide what to do. It may be that it would
be better to go away. I cannot tell, now.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTell me, Jos√©, have your troubles any connection
with the Gypsies?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he assented.
</p>
<p>
A shadowy figure moved up the lawn and approached
the house. Jos√© stirred uneasily.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you
think you had better go in?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied Barbara. ‚ÄúI am not afraid, if
you are not.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
It was Zerlina, and, seeing the two people on
the porch, she paused irresolutely.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat is it, Zerlina?‚Äù called Barbara. ‚ÄúDo
you want to see anyone?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy grandmother is over there,‚Äù replied the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
girl, pointing to the shrubbery. ‚ÄúShe has come
to tell fortunes, if it pleases the ladies.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Zerlina did not look at Bab, as she spoke.
She was looking at Jos√©, long and curiously.
And he returned the gaze with interest.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou have not seen Mr. Martinez, Zerlina?‚Äù
asked Bab, recalling how he had stolen away in
the woods when the Gypsy danced for them.
</p>
<p>
Zerlina bowed coldly, and Jos√© took off his
cavalier hat; but neither said a word, and Bab
felt somewhat embarrassed at the silence.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait a moment, Zerlina, and I will ask the
major about the fortunes,‚Äù she said, stepping
through the French window. Just as she parted
the curtain, she turned to say something to Jos√©,
and saw Zerlina quickly hand him a note. Bab‚Äôs
face flushed angrily.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis business ought to be stopped,‚Äù she said
to herself. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll all be slain in our beds some
fine night. Why can‚Äôt Jos√© be frank? The entire
band of Gypsies might be a lot of robbers,
for all we know.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The revelers inside were all interested to know
that Granny Ann had come at last to tell fortunes,
and Zerlina was dispatched at once to
bring her grandmother back. When the old
woman passed through the room on her way to
the library, where the fortunes were to be told,
she took a rapid survey of everybody there. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
examined the girls and boys in their masquerade
costumes, looked curiously at Jimmie‚Äôs bandaged
countenance, and finally her eyes rested
on Jos√© leaning on a balcony rail outside.
</p>
<p>
While the fortunes were being told, there was
a concert in the drawing room. Grace sang in
her high, sweet soprano voice, followed by
another of Zerlina‚Äôs Gypsy songs. Then Jos√©
was induced to sing a beautiful Spanish love
song, and finally Jimmie gave a comic version
of ‚ÄúThe Old Homestead‚Äù in which he himself
acted every part.
</p>
<p>
After the fortunes were told Granny Ann sent
word that there was one person she had not seen,
and go she would not until she had seen him.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWho has not yet been in?‚Äù demanded the
major.
</p>
<p>
There was no reply.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√©, you have not seen her, have you?‚Äù
asked Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied Jos√©; ‚ÄúI do not wish to go.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Word was sent in to Granny Ann, who sent a
message back that she insisted on seeing the
young man.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, go ahead, Jos√©,‚Äù urged Stephen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
only for a few minutes, and we want to have
another dance before bedtime.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Jos√© bowed and disappeared from the room.
Soon after Mollie touched Bab on the arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab,‚Äù she whispered, ‚Äúcome out on the
porch. I have something to tell you.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The two girls stole out onto the moonlit
piazza, while Mollie continued in a low voice:
‚ÄúI know I should not have done it, but I followed
Jos√© into the library, by the dining-room
door, and hid behind a curtain. I was curious
to see what Granny Ann would do. He had
hardly got into the room before she commenced
talking in a loud voice. She spoke in a foreign
language, but she seemed terribly angry, and
shook her fist in his face. He was quite gentle
with her, and just stood there, pale and quiet.
I felt so sorry for him. Once I thought she
would strike him, but he never flinched or
dodged. What do you suppose it means, Bab,
dear?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Mollie,‚Äù replied Barbara,
‚ÄúThere is some mystery about Jos√©. Something
happened to-day that put him in a very
unfortunate light, but I‚Äôd rather not tell you
until to-morrow. Don‚Äôt dance with him any
more to-night, but be kind to him, little sister,‚Äù
Bab added, ‚Äúfor I do feel sorry for him.‚Äù
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX‚ÄîA RECOGNITION</h2>
<p>
The masqueraders had separated for the
night; Bab, however, had asked to speak
with the major before he went to his
room. For half an hour she was closeted with
him in his library. The time had arrived to tell
him everything she knew about Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
The major had listened to her attentively. He
had felt reluctance to believe anything against
a guest, just on a mere chance resemblance, but
certainly the circle was closing in around Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you think we had better do anything
about it to-night?‚Äù he asked the girl, almost
childishly. He felt obliged to ask advice in this
very difficult situation, and who could give any
better counsel than this fine, young woman, who
had been able to keep a secret, and who was so
wholesome and sweet with all her reserve?
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what you could do, Major, in case
he admitted he was guilty. You couldn‚Äôt arrest
him very well to-night, unless you wanted
to bind his arms and feet and take him to the
nearest town. I don‚Äôt believe he has any idea
of running away, because he doesn‚Äôt know we
suspect him. At least he only vaguely knows it.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd, after all,‚Äù said the kindly old major,
‚Äúit‚Äôs a pity to rout him out of his comfortable
bed to-night. We will give the poor fellow another
good night‚Äôs rest, and take one ourselves,
too. Shall we not, little woman?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, indeed, Major,‚Äù agreed Barbara, looking
into his kindly, troubled eyes with respect
and admiration. ‚ÄúAnd who knows? Maybe,
in the morning, he can explain everything.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIndeed, my dear, I hope so,‚Äù he replied,
opening the door for her and bowing good-night
as if she had been Miss Sallie herself.
</p>
<p>
As Barbara started up the long staircase she
felt lonely. The hall below looked vast and
dark. Only a dim light was burning and every
door was closed. Emerging from the shadows
around the staircase she might have been a ghost
of one of the early Ten Eycks in her old-fashioned
peach-colored silk, with its full trailing
skirt and pointed bodice. She hurried a little
and wished she had got over the long space of
hall which lay between her and her room; but
she had scarcely taken a dozen steps before the
door behind her opened. She stopped and
looked back, thinking perhaps it was one of the
servants waiting to put out the lights.
</p>
<p>
Standing in the doorway was a very old man.
He carried a candle in one hand, and was peering
at her in the darkness with that same expression of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
wonder and surprise on his face that
she had remembered to have seen before, for
this was their third encounter, once in the woods,
once in the library, and now.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBarbara! Barbara Thurston!‚Äù he called in
a quavering voice. ‚ÄúI have been waiting
for you so long, so many years. I am old
now and you are still young.‚Äù He stretched out
his arms and came toward her.
</p>
<p>
Bab flew and almost ran into Jos√©, who
opened his door at that moment. When they
recovered themselves the old man was gone.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhich way did he go?‚Äù asked Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
Bab pointed to the door without speaking,
and, still trembling from fright, burst into her
own room, where a strange scene was taking
place. Three high-backed chairs were arranged
in a row. Ruth in a dressing gown was
crouching behind them, while Mollie and Grace
sat hand in hand on the bed, giving little gasps
of excitement and horror.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis is the clump of bushes,‚Äù Ruth was saying,
‚Äúand the three fights took place here and
here, and here,‚Äù she went on, marking the spots
with her toe. ‚ÄúStephen and his man, who was
none other than the giant tramp, fought straight
out from the shoulder like this,‚Äù and she hit the
air furiously with her doubled fists. ‚ÄúThen
came Alfred and his friend. They didn‚Äôt hit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
They gripped and rolled over and over in the
dust. And last of all, poor Jimmie, who, in
five minutes, lay like a warrior taking his rest.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Ruth Stuart,‚Äù interrupted Bab, ‚ÄúI
thought we were not to tell.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSh-h! Don‚Äôt make so much noise, Bab.
Aunt Sallie thinks we were safe in bed long ago.
I‚Äôm not betraying confidence. Stephen told me
I could tell Mollie and Grace if he could tell
Martin. But, Bab, dear, what is the matter?
Have you seen a ghost?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Bab, ‚Äúor rather the next
thing to one. Really, girls, I‚Äôm getting more
than my fair share this time. Ruth was in the
fight, of course, but none of you have seen the
old man who haunts the place, and I have seen
him three times. He seems to be a perfectly
harmless old man, but it does give one a start to
meet him at midnight in a dark hall.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, Barbara, are you dreaming? What
does it mean?‚Äù cried Mollie, seizing her sister‚Äôs
hand and pulling her over on the bed beside
them. ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you told us before?‚Äù she
added with a sisterly reproach. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no fair
keeping secrets all the time.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am tired of secrets, too,‚Äù said Bab, ‚ÄúI
started with major and I‚Äôll just finish the thing
before I lay me down this night to rest.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
When Bab had concluded her ghostly tale the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
girls were really frightened. They tried the
doors, opened all the closets and wardrobes and
peered under the beds of both rooms.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo one could climb up to these windows,‚Äù
exclaimed Mollie. ‚ÄúBut suppose there should
be a secret door into one of these rooms?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat a horrible idea, Mollie Thurston!‚Äù exclaimed
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
There was a sharp tap on the door. The four
girls jumped as if they had been shot, and rushed
together like frightened chickens.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls,‚Äù said Miss Sallie‚Äôs voice, ‚Äúgo to bed
this instant!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRight away, Aunt Sallie, dear,‚Äù answered
her niece. When they were comfortably tucked
in for the night, Ruth said to Bab:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow do you suppose he knew your name?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù replied her friend, ‚Äúunless
I had a twin ancestor.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
At eleven o‚Äôclock the next morning the
major‚Äôs guests assembled for a late breakfast.
The boys were stiff from their encounters with
the tramps, and Jimmie, especially, was an object
of pity. The major looked serious. He
had a disagreeable duty to perform, and he
wished to avoid it as long as possible. Miss Sallie,
alone, was animated and talkative. She had
been entrusted with no confidences, and she felt
the burden of no secrets. Neither did she guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
that something was impending that was bound
to surprise and horrify her.
</p>
<p>
Jos√© had not made his appearance and the
major was relieved. The hour of reckoning was
at hand, and he wished it over and done with.
His old friend‚Äôs son! Was it possible that a
child of Jos√© Martinez could have so far forgotten
the laws of hospitality as to rob and intrigue,
and play tricks on his fellow guests?
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat a quiet, dull lot of people you are,‚Äù
exclaimed Miss Sallie, who at last began to notice
the gloom that had settled on the party.
‚ÄúWhat is the matter?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think it must be the weather, Miss Stuart,‚Äù
replied Stephen, coming to the rescue of the
others. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very oppressively warm day,
and the air is so dry it makes me thirsty.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the sort of weather, I imagine, they must
have in plague-stricken southern countries,‚Äù
observed Ruth, ‚Äúwhere there‚Äôs no water,‚Äù she
continued drawing the picture which held her
imagination, ‚Äúand people are dropping around
with cholera or the bubonic plague.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCheerful!‚Äù exclaimed Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI wonder where Jos√© is this morning,‚Äù
said Stephen, voicing the thought of everybody
in the room except the unconscious Miss
Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSuppose you run up and see,‚Äù suggested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
the major. ‚ÄúTell him, Steenie,‚Äù he added, patting
his nephew affectionately on the shoulder,
‚Äúthat I wish to see him in the morning room
when he finishes his breakfast. And, Stephen,
my boy, don‚Äôt be rough with him. Remember
what an ordeal we‚Äôll have to put him through
later. Good heavens!‚Äù he groaned, ‚Äúsuch a
lovely boy! If it only had not happened in my
house!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps he can explain, in spite of everything,‚Äù
replied Stephen.
</p>
<p>
Presently he returned to the library.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√© is not in his room. He didn‚Äôt sleep
there last night. His bed is made up and there‚Äôs
not a wrinkle on it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, where can he be?‚Äù cried the major.
‚ÄúHe couldn‚Äôt have run away, could he?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPerhaps he is taking a morning walk,‚Äù suggested
Martin.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDid he take anything with him!‚Äù asked
Jimmie. ‚ÄúI mean are his things in his room?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice,‚Äù replied Stephen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd
better ask some of the servants, first, if they
have seen him this morning, and then go back
and have a look for ourselves.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But the servants could give no information.
On examining Jos√©‚Äôs room they found everything
just as he had left it. He had taken nothing in
his flight, not even a comb and brush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúEven his pearl shirt studs are here,‚Äù said
Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow about his leather motor clothes?‚Äù asked
Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHere they are,‚Äù replied his friend.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow about his motor cycle?‚Äù asked the
major with a sudden thought.
</p>
<p>
They ran down stairs and through the open
door, followed by ‚ÄúThe Automobile Girls,‚Äù who
were filled with excitement. At the garage the
chauffeur was busy cleaning the motor cars.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIs Mr. Martinez‚Äôs motor cycle here, Josef?‚Äù
demanded the major.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù answered the chauffeur looking
up from his work, surprised at the visit of so
many people at once.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHave you see him this morning?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù said the major. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt understand
it. He must simply have slipped out of
the house and gone for a long walk.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúUncle,‚Äù said Stephen, ‚Äúsuppose we wait until
after lunch.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWait for what, my boy?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, for Jos√©, I mean. And then, if he
doesn‚Äôt turn up, we had better search for him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The party sat about listlessly until lunch time.
It was too hot to talk and the oppressiveness of
the atmosphere gave them an uneasy feeling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
Jos√© had not taken even a hat, so Stephen said,
and it turned out that only the day before the
Spaniard had entrusted the major with a large
sum of money to be locked in the family strong
box until his visit was over.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen,‚Äù exclaimed the major, finally, as
the afternoon began to wane, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand this
any longer. The boy may have wandered into
the woods and been attacked by some of those
tramp ruffians. Order the horses. We‚Äôll ride
to the Gypsy camp and take the road to town.
Tell the girls to explain the situation to Miss
Sallie while we are gone.‚Äù
</p>
<h2><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX‚ÄîTHE FIRE BRIGADE</h2>
<p>
Ruth and Barbara related to Miss Sallie
their adventures of the day before. She
went through a dozen stages of emotion,
and fairly wrung her hands over the tramps.
The part about Jos√© she could not believe.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat nice boy!‚Äù she exclaimed. ‚ÄúIt is impossible.‚Äù
Then she grew indignant. ‚ÄúWhat
does John Ten Eyck mean by bringing us into
this lawless country, I should like to know?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, auntie, the major declares it was never
like this before. The woods have always been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
perfectly safe. When Stephen and Martin
were little boys they used to play in them with
only Old Jennie to look after them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù cried Miss Sallie, ‚Äúthe major is one
of the nicest men in the world, but he always
would overlook disagreeable things. He runs
away from anything that hurts. He may have
overlooked the tramps and robbers, just as he
has been blind to ugliness whenever he could.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a dear,‚Äù said Mollie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDear or no dear,‚Äù cried Miss Sallie, ‚Äúthis
time we really must go. Tell the chauffeur to
fix up the machine, Ruth, my child, for to-morrow
we shall leave this barbarous place.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll right, auntie,‚Äù replied her niece, relieved
that they were not to go immediately, since they
all wanted to see the episode of Jos√© through.
</p>
<p>
Time passed, but the four horsemen did not
return. The girls were sitting with Miss Sallie
at the shady end of the piazza, watching the sun
sink behind the forest. There was a smell of
burning in the air that the sensitive nostrils of
the chaperon had sniffed immediately.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe wind must be blowing from the mountains
to-day,‚Äù she observed. ‚ÄúI smell burning
as plainly as if it were at our gates.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, Miss Sallie,‚Äù said Grace, ‚Äúremember
that it smelt like this in New York last week.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy dear,‚Äù replied Miss Sallie, ‚ÄúI am perfectly familiar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
with the smell of burning forests,
I have smelt them so often in imagination.
Why, see, the air is filled with fine ashes,‚Äù she
exclaimed, shaking out her lavender skirts with
disgust. She had hardly spoken before a tall
figure was seen hurrying across the lawn.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs blind Jennie,‚Äù cried Ruth. ‚ÄúPerhaps
she can give us news of the major or Jos√©.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
As old Jennie approached they could see she
was fearfully excited. Her face was working
and several times she waved her stick wildly in
the air. Just then a strange thing happened.
Half a dozen terrified deer appeared from the
direction of the forest, dashed madly across the
lawn and disappeared in a grove on the other
side. Squirrels and rabbits followed by the
dozens, while distracted birds flew in groups and
circled around and around the tops of the trees.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat has happened, Jennie?‚Äù cried Ruth,
shaking the blind woman by the arm.
</p>
<p>
Jennie seemed to scan the company with her
sightless eyes, sniffing the air wildly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe woods are burning,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe
flames are coming nearer. They are slow, but
they are sure. Everything is so dry. You must
hurry, if you would save the house!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSave the house?‚Äù repeated Miss Stuart
mechanically. ‚ÄúDo you mean to say there is
danger of this house being burned down? Is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
the fire coming this way? Great heavens! Order
the car at once, children. We must leave
at any cost. This is the last straw!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut, Aunt Sallie,‚Äù urged Ruth, laying a detaining
hand on her aunt‚Äôs arm, ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt
have us desert the major‚Äôs house, would you,
and leave all these beautiful things to burn?
Besides, we may be running away from the
major and the boys. How do we know but that
they are in the woods? They may need our
help.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy child, we are not a fire department,‚Äù exclaimed
Miss Sallie, ‚Äúand if we are to save this
beautiful house, how do you propose to do it?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf worse comes to worst,‚Äù cried Bab, ‚Äúwe
can form a bucket brigade here, and keep the
fire from getting to the house.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat about water?‚Äù demanded Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember the major said he had
a well of water reserved for fires?‚Äù said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt may not be necessary to use the water,‚Äù
Bab continued. ‚ÄúThe first thing to do is to cut
off the forest fire by having a trench dug on that
side of the house. Everybody will have to get
to work. Come on! We must not lose time.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie ran into the hall and rang a bell
violently. John, the butler, came at once.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù she cried, speaking very rapidly,
‚Äúthe forest is on fire. Get every available person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
on the place as fast as you can, with shovels
and hoes and help the young ladies dig a trench
to protect the major‚Äôs house.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
John looked dazed, sniffed the air and ran
without a word. Presently a bell thundered
out in the stillness. It had not been rung for
many years, but the employees on the place knew
what it meant, and came running from their cottages,
and the work of digging a trench beyond
Ten Eyck Hall was begun. Each moment the
air was growing more dense and a darkness was
settling down which was lit up, toward the west,
by a lurid glow. The heat was intense and fine
ashes filled the toilers‚Äô throats and nostrils. Birds,
blinded by the smoke dashed past, almost hitting
the workers‚Äô faces. People came running from
the burning forest, the old Gypsy woman and
her granddaughter and other women from the
Gypsy band. The men were bringing the
wagons around by the road; old Adam and his
wife, driving their wood cart and frantically
beating the worn-out horse; and finally, the
hermit, with his white locks flying. Ten Eyck
Hall would seem to have been the refuge of all
these terrified dwellers in the forest. They regarded
it with pride and love. Even the Gypsies
had sought its protection, and the gray, rambling
old place appeared to stretch out its arms to
them. Blind Jennie strode up and down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
lawn, wildly waving her stick, while old Adam
called to Miss Sallie:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhere is the master? Where are the
young masters?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And where were the old master and the young
ones? If ever they were needed, it was now!
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the girls, leaving Miss Sallie
to direct the digging of the trench, had run
to the house.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI think, Ruth,‚Äù called Bab, ‚Äúwe had better
collect all the buckets and pails we can find.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Ruth, ‚Äúand the hose should
be attached to the reserve well. John is attending
to that. Mollie and Grace, run and get
whatever blankets there are in the bed rooms,
and close the windows all over the house.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
While John was attaching the hose to the
faucet of the reserve well, Ruth and Bab invaded
the enormous kitchen of the hall. The
servants had fled. Only Mary and John
could be depended upon. The pumping engine
had been started and the tank was rapidly
filling.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúO Ruth,‚Äù exclaimed Bab, ‚Äúhow careless of
us to have forgotten the cars! The garage is
nearest to the forest and the automobiles should
be run out right off. We may need them if
things get very bad.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù replied Ruth. ‚ÄúWhere is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
chauffeur? Did you ever know any of these
people to be on hand when they were needed?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Dashing to the garage, they cranked up the
two machines and ran them out onto the lawn in
an open space. Jos√©‚Äôs motor cycle came next.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe fire has come,‚Äù cried Grace and Mollie
running up with their arms full of blankets.
They could hear the roaring, crackling sound as
the flames licked their way through the dry underbrush.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhere is Miss Sallie?‚Äù demanded Ruth.
‚ÄúShe will faint in this terrible atmosphere.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere she is,‚Äù answered Grace; ‚Äúshe is
overseeing the trench-digging. I think she has
ordered them to make it broader.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie, her lavender skirts caught up
over her arm, was standing near the men, giving
her orders as calmly as if she were in her own
drawing room.
</p>
<p>
The line of forest about a quarter of a mile
distant began to glow red. The girls clutched
each other.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere it is!‚Äù they cried. ‚ÄúAnd now to save
the major‚Äôs house!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Bab organized a bucket brigade with Mollie,
Grace and the Gypsy women. John was ordered
to manipulate the hose, while Bab and
Ruth carried wet blankets over to the garage,
the building nearest the line of fire. Then a cry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
went up from the men who were digging the
trench. The flames, which had been steadily devouring
the dried grass of the meadow dividing
the garden from the wood, had reached the
trench. A sudden gust of wind carried them
over. Instantly a group of bushes caught fire;
and, like an angry animal seeking its prey, a
long, forked tongue licked the ground hungrily
for a moment, paused at the gravel walk, followed
its edge, eating up the short, dry grass in
its path, and made for the garage. All this happened
in much quicker time than it takes to tell
it‚Äîtoo quickly, in fact for any precaution.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI‚ÄîFIGHTING THE FLAMES</h2>
<p>
Never had ‚ÄúThe Automobile Girls‚Äù displayed
greater courage than at this critical
moment. It was the time for quick
action and quicker thought. The men who were
digging the trench could not leave their work.
They saw that, unless the trench were dug wider,
it would be necessary to fight the flames back,
and they were digging like mad to keep the fire
from leaping the ditch again.
</p>
<p>
It was Mollie who saved them from a terrible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
explosion by remembering the house where the
gasoline was stored just behind the garage, and
John and Adam rolled the tank to a distance
temporarily safe at least.
</p>
<p>
Bab had found a ladder somewhere. Placing
it against the garage she had scaled it like a
monkey, carrying under one arm a wet blanket
the weight of which she was too excited to notice.
She never quite knew how she shinned up
the roof, but presently she found herself astride
the pinnacle. Zerlina had followed close behind,
with more blankets and together the two girls
spread them over the smoking shingles. When
the roof was covered, they let themselves down
and began dashing water on the smouldering
walls. The bucket brigade was working well
under the direction of Ruth, and the garage was
saved.
</p>
<p>
Then a line of clipped bushes running from
the garden to the forest, suddenly burst into
flames. A cry went up from the workers at this
terrifying spectacle. To the girls, it seemed
like a gigantic boa constrictor racing toward
them, and, for a moment, they turned cold with
fear.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll hands must help here!‚Äù cried Bab, taking
command, as she naturally did in times of
danger. ‚ÄúZerlina, tell the men to come from
the trench with their shovels. Bring pails of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
water, all of you,‚Äù she called to the Gypsies,
‚Äúand the rest of the wet blankets.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was a rush and a scramble. They tried
to beat down the angry little flames, dashed
water on to them, choked them with wet blankets,
trampled on them, and finally fell back, stifled
and blinded with smoke and ashes, only to find
the gasoline house a burning mass. It had gone
up like a tinder box in an instant, and was reduced
to ruins.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf we have any more gusts of wind like that
last, Bab, we are lost!‚Äù cried Ruth, sobbing a
little under her breath. ‚ÄúBut, of course, if the
worst happens, we can always take the automobiles.
They can run faster than the flames.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Back of the garage they could see another line
of flames advancing like a regiment of cavalry.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGreat heavens!‚Äù cried Grace. ‚ÄúWhat shall
we do now?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt despair, yet,‚Äù answered Bab. ‚ÄúThose
dividing hedges are very dry, but the flames
don‚Äôt spread from them so quickly; and, besides,
I believe the trench will stop them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúO Bab,‚Äù exclaimed Ruth, ‚Äúdo you think
there will ever be an end to this? We are too
tired to dig trenches, and the water is getting
alarmingly low.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut there are two more cisterns,‚Äù replied
the undaunted Bab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
Just then the wind, which, up to this time, except
for a few brief gusts, had been merely a
breeze, gathered new strength. Sparks began
to fly from the burning underbrush in the wood.
It had been a ground fire, owing to the long
drought, and the trees still waved their green
branches over the ruins at their feet.
</p>
<p>
Ruth seized Bab‚Äôs hand convulsively.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYoung ladies!‚Äù called a voice behind them.
Turning, they confronted the hermit. ‚ÄúI am a
very old man, but, if you will permit me, I will
make a suggestion. Save what water is left for
the roof, which should be deluged as soon as
possible. The trench will stop the fire, but it
cannot keep back the sparks and I see a wind
has come up that is most dangerous.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, thank you,‚Äù cried the two girls, seeing
the wisdom of his suggestion immediately.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sallie, a tragic spectacle, came from
around the house; her white hair tumbling down
her back, her face gray with ashes and her lavender
garments torn and wet.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls,‚Äù she murmured, her voice trembling,
from fatigue and excitement, ‚Äúwe have done all
we could do for the major. I think we had better
give it up and go while we can get away.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLet us have one more chance. Aunt Sallie,
dearest,‚Äù begged Ruth, ‚Äúand if that fails there
will still be time to get away in the motor car.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat are you going to do now, child?‚Äù
asked the poor woman distractedly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou go and sit down in one of the long
chairs on the piazza and rest,‚Äù replied her niece,
patting her hand tenderly, ‚Äúand leave everything
to us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The girls could hear the throbbing of the
pumping engine somewhere below, as they
dashed up the steps. John had connected all
the cisterns and the machinery was working in
good order. The candles and lanterns they carried
hardly made an impression in the blackness
of the great empty garret, but an exclamation
from John called attention to the fact that
the sliding partition was down.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI never knew it to happen before,‚Äù he said,
‚Äúexcept once when I was too small to understand.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow are we going to manage?‚Äù asked Grace,
looking overhead.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThrough the scuttle to the roof,‚Äù replied
Barbara, pointing to a ladder leading to a trapdoor.
</p>
<p>
John climbed up first, opening the scuttle, and
everybody lent a hand in lifting out the hose he
had brought along. Barbara and Zerlina followed
to the roof, which was steep and much
broken by pinnacles and turrets; yet in contrast
with the attic it was quite light outside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
and the girls could see perfectly where to step
without slipping.
</p>
<p>
Only two people were needed, it was decided.
Bab would not hear of Ruth‚Äôs coming, on account
of the latter‚Äôs horror of high places. It was
certain that Mollie and Grace were not agile
enough for the experiment, and Bab and Zerlina
had already proved what they could do
when they scaled the garage roof.
</p>
<p>
The three girls left behind climbed onto a balcony
just outside one of the attic windows and
watched, with tremulous interest, what was happening
on the roof.
</p>
<p>
Thus Zerlina and Barbara, with old John,
were left alone on top of Ten Eyck Hall. They
had a wonderful view of the smoking forest,
the tops of whose trees were waving in the steadily
rising wind. The trench had, indeed,
stopped the course of the flames which had run
along the meadow hedges, and there were no
more lines of fire to be seen; but there was a
bright glow toward the back and a sound of
crackling wood. Then came a burst of flames
and the onlooker saw that the stable was burning.
A spark lit on Bab‚Äôs wrist; another touched
her on the cheek, and presently a gust of wind
brought dozens of them twinkling like shooting
stars at night. They fell on the shingled roof,
smouldered for a moment and went out. Others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
followed. It could be only a matter of a little
while, thought Bab, before the hall would be in
flames if they were not prompt with the water.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, Miss,‚Äù called John‚Äôs voice from
behind the tank on the part of the roof over the
attic. There was a gurgling noise and a swift
jet of water burst from the nozzle of the hose.
</p>
<p>
With Zerlina‚Äôs assistance, Bab began watering
the roof. But the tallest peak was beyond
reach of the hose. There the sparks were
smouldering into life and Bab distinctly saw a
a little puff of flame lick out and then go back
again like a cunning animal biding its time.
</p>
<p>
Bab ran over to the tank.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù she called, ‚Äúget a ladder and a pail.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Together they unhooked the ladder attached
to the tank and dragged it over to the high center
peak of the roof. There was a pail, also,
which they filled with water. While the old man
held the ladder Bab climbed up, taking the pail
from Zerlina. Several times the brave girl
dashed water over the smoking shingles until
every spark was dead. Then, standing on one
foot, on the top rung of the ladder, Bab braced
herself with a lightning rod running up the side
of the turret, and leaned over to see if all were
well on its other section. Below her she could
see the girls on the balcony peering up at her
with frightened eyes. Lifting herself entirely
off the ladder, for an instant, Bab glanced
around the turret. In slipping back, her foot
missed the rung. The shock made her lose her
grip on the lightning rod, and like a flash she
slid down the steepest part of the roof now slippery
from its recent wetting. There was nothing
to hold to, nothing to cling to, and she closed
her eyes from the horror that was before her.
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>
It is said that a great many things pass
through one‚Äôs mind at such brief, tense moments
as these, when death is almost certain.
</p>
<p>
The thought that came to Bab‚Äôs mind, however,
was her mother‚Äôs prayer, ‚ÄúHeaven make
me calm in the face of danger.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was, of course, a shudder of horror, a
wild, ineffectual effort to save herself‚Äîa shock.
</p>
<p>
When she opened her eyes, three pairs of arms
encircled her, and three sobbing faces hovered
over her. She had landed upon the roof of the
balcony where the girls were waiting. Except
for a bruised arm, she had met with no harm.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, girlies,‚Äù she said, smiling a little
weakly, ‚Äúwere you so frightened?‚Äù and then
closed her eyes again.
</p>
<p>
Zerlina and John came tumbling down the
ladder. The Gypsy girl was as white as a sheet
and old John was openly sobbing.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm all right,‚Äù Bab assured them, standing
up and shaking herself to bring her senses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
back. She bathed her throbbing wrists and
temples, and all climbed down into the lower
regions of the house. It was decided to water
the side of the house, and after that nothing
more could be done. The whole place was lit up
with the burning stable, and sparks were flying
in every direction. The wind had risen to a gale
and the skies were overhung with a black canopy
of clouds kindled by occasional flashes of lightning.
There was a low grumbling sound of
thunder. Down the avenue came the clatter of
horses‚Äô hoofs. At the same time there was a terrific
clap, and the rain poured down in torrents.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHere they are!‚Äù cried the girls as Major
Ten Eyck and the boys leaped from their
horses and dashed up the piazza steps. Jos√©
was not with them.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII‚ÄîEXPLANATIONS</h2>
<p>
The major and his nephews were shocked
at the appearance of their guests, who
were hardly recognizable. Jimmie Butler
retired behind a curtain and give vent to one
little chuckle. He would not, for anything, have
let them know how funny they looked.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI shall never forgive myself for leaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
you,‚Äù groaned Major Ten Eyck. ‚ÄúWhy did
you not take the car and leave the old place to
burn? How can the boys and I ever thank
you?‚Äù he continued, with emotion.
</p>
<p>
Before Stephen would give an account of the
search for Jos√© he made Ruth repeat the history
of the afternoon from beginning to end. The
major and the boys were filled with admiration
and wonder for these four brave ‚ÄúAutomobile
Girls‚Äù and Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere is nothing we can do,‚Äù exclaimed Jimmie,
‚Äúto show what we feel, except to lie down
and let you walk over us.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd now for Jos√©,‚Äù prompted Ruth, when
she had finished her story.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù replied Stephen, ‚Äúwe got news of
Jos√© almost as soon as we had passed the Gypsy
camp. A man on the road told us he had seen
a boy who answered the description exactly,
walking on the edge of the forest. We traced
him back into the country to a farm house,
where according to the farmer, he had stopped
for a drink of water and turned back again toward
the forest. It was necessary to come back
by a roundabout way because of the cliffs on the
outer edge, and not until we reached the hermit‚Äôs
house did we realize there was a fire that must
have been started by those tramps, for it was at
its worst about where they were yesterday. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
were frantic when we saw that it was blowing
in the direction of the hall, but we couldn‚Äôt get
through and had to go the whole way around.
Our only comfort, when we saw the glow of the
burning stable, was that you had taken the automobile
and gone back to Tarrytown.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The faithful old butler appeared with lights,
and informed the major that the other servants
had returned very repentant, and if agreeable,
dinner would be served in half an hour.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBut I think the ladies will be much too tired
to come down again,‚Äù protested the major.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, no, we won‚Äôt,‚Äù answered Ruth. ‚ÄúIf
there‚Äôs enough water left to wash in I would
rather dress and come downstairs for food.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSo would we all,‚Äù chorused the others, except
Miss Sallie, who took to her bed immediately,
and dropped off to sleep as soon as her
head touched the pillow.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen,‚Äù asked Ruth at dinner, ‚Äúdo you believe
poor Jos√© was caught in the fire?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather a horrible idea,‚Äù said Stephen,
‚Äúyet I don‚Äôt know what else to think. He must
have caught wind, somehow, that we had found
him out and concluded to hide in the woods.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOld Jennie wishes to speak to you, sir,‚Äù announced
John.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBring her in here,‚Äù ordered the major, and
Jennie was ushered into the dining-room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
‚ÄúHow are you, Jennie? I am glad to see you,‚Äù
said the major, leading her to a chair. ‚ÄúI
hope you were not injured by the fire?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBe there anyone here but friends?‚Äù whispered
Jennie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo one, Jennie. What is it?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhen the storm came up I went straight to
the forest,‚Äù said the old woman. ‚ÄúAdam went
with me and we took his horse and wagon. The
fire had not touched the road and the ground
was wet where we walked. As we passed by
the place‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù here she put her finger to her
lips and gazed wildly about, ‚Äúyou remember,
young ladies? I went over to see if all was well.
The door was open and on the floor lay the
young man. He is not dead, but he is very ill
here,‚Äù old Jennie pressed her hand to her chest.
‚ÄúHe has swallowed the smoke. We put him in
the wagon and he is outside.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√© here? Outside?‚Äù they all cried at
once, rushing to the front door.
</p>
<p>
In the pouring rain, Zerlina and her grandmother
were leaning over a young man stretched
out prone in Adam‚Äôs wagon. He wore the green
velveteen suit now so familiar to ‚ÄúThe Automobile
Girls,‚Äù and through his belt gleamed the
dagger he had used to slash the tires with.
When he was lifted out, they caught a glimpse of
his face. Jos√© it was, but Jos√© grown thin and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
haggard in a day and a night. The boys carried
him tenderly upstairs and laid him on his
own bed. Zerlina and her grandmother followed
close at their heels.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDo you know him, then?‚Äù asked Stephen of
the Gypsy girl.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she replied defiantly. ‚ÄúHe is my
brother. Antonio is his name.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhew-w-w,‚Äù whistled Stephen under his
breath. ‚ÄúSo Jos√© was an impostor after all. I
must say I hoped till the last.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù answered the major, ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt
hit a man when he is down, my son, and this
boy is pretty sick. The girl is his sister, you
say? She and her grandmother had better
nurse him, then. Send the old woman to me.
I want to speak with her in the library.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
After being closeted with Granny Ann for
half an hour the major flung wide the library
door and called to the others to come in. His
good-natured, handsome face was wrinkled into
an expression of utter bewilderment, but relief
gleamed through his troubled eyes.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúChildren,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúcome here, every one
of you. Jos√© is vindicated. Thank heavens
for that. The boy upstairs is not our Jos√© at
all, but his half-brother, Antonio. Now, where
do you suppose Jos√© has hidden himself? I
trust, I earnestly hope, not in the woods.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt seems,‚Äù continued the major, ‚ÄúJos√©‚Äôs
father was married twice. A nice chap, Jos√©.
I trust he is safe to-night, for his poor father‚Äôs
sake as well as for his own.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd his second wife, uncle?‚Äù interrupted
Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes, yes, my boy,‚Äù continued the major,
patting his nephew affectionately on the
shoulder, ‚Äúand the second wife was a beautiful
Gypsy singer, who had two children, Zerlina
and Antonio, the unfortunate young man
now occupying Jos√©‚Äôs room. A Gypsy rarely
marries outside her own people and this one
longed to return to her tribe. One day she ran
away taking her children with her, and Martinez
never saw his wife again, for she died soon
after. He has tried, in every way, to recover
the children, but until now the Gypsies have always
managed to hide them effectually. Since
they were children Antonio has hated his half
brother Jos√© and from time to time has threatened
his life. Once, in Gibraltar, the brother
almost succeeded in killing him.‚Äù (The girls
remembered how much Jos√© had disliked the
mention of Gibraltar.) ‚ÄúAntonio was a bad boy,
utterly undisciplined. He ran about Europe
and this country, seeing what harm he could do,
but neither his father nor his brother could ever
locate him. Jos√© finally heard that the children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
were in America and came over to try to reason
with the Gypsies to let Zerlina, at least, go
to school. I do not suppose he reckoned on finding
them so near, and, when Antonio tried to rob
and murder, Jos√© was divided in his mind as to
whether to give his brother up or let him go.
He must have suffered a good deal, poor fellow.
I wish Jos√© had confided his troubles to
me. Now, maybe, it‚Äôs too late to help him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd the knife?‚Äù asked Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere were two knives which belonged to
the Martinez family. The Gypsy took one away
with her when she left her husband.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWill Antonio stay here to-night, Major?‚Äù
said Mollie, timidly, remembering the masked
robber and his murderous weapon.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe is too ill, now, to do any harm, little
one,‚Äù replied the major, taking her hand. ‚ÄúBesides,
his grandmother and sister will watch
over him I feel certain, and who knows but the
boy may have some good in him after all?‚Äù he
added, always trying to see the best in everybody.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNevertheless, we‚Äôll lock our doors,‚Äù exclaimed
Ruth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so easy to forget that
our highwayman is sleeping across the hall.‚Äù
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII‚ÄîAN OLD ROMANCE</h2>
<p>
Bab had hardly reached her room before
she was summoned to the door by
Stephen, looking so serious and unhappy
that she felt at once something had happened.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBab,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI am afraid you are not
done with your day‚Äôs work yet for the Ten
Eyck family. I am about to ask you a favor,
and I must confide something to you that has
been a secret with us now for three generations.
First, are you afraid to go with me over to the
right wing? John and Mary will go, too, and
you need really have nothing to fear, but the
dread‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he paused and bit his lip.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy, no, Stephen, I am not afraid,‚Äù replied
Bab, ‚Äúand I promise to guard faithfully any secret
you want to tell me,‚Äù she added, giving him
her hand in token of her pledge. She suspected
they were going to visit the old man she had seen
wandering about the house and forest.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI will tell you the secret as we go along,‚Äù
Stephen said, leading the way to the end of the
hall, where they found Mary and John waiting.
The four started down a long passage opening
into the right wing of the building. ‚ÄúWe are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
going, now,‚Äù continued Stephen, ‚Äúto visit a
very old man who lives in the right wing. He
is my great-uncle, Stephen Ten Eyck. When
he was quite a young man he met with a sorrow
that unhinged his mind and he‚Äîwell, he committed
a crime. It was never proved that he
had done it, but the Ten Eyck family knew he
had. However, his most intimate friend took
the blame upon his shoulders.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhy did he do that?‚Äù asked Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBecause, Bab,‚Äù replied Stephen, ‚Äúthey both
loved a girl, and the girl‚Äôs name was Barbara
Thurston. She must have been your great-great-aunt.
Did you ever hear of her?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIf I ever did, I have forgotten,‚Äù answered
Bab. ‚ÄúYou see, after father‚Äôs death, we had
no way to learn much about his family and
mother knew very little, I suppose.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWell, Barbara Thurston was engaged to
marry my great-uncle. They were all staying
at the same hotel, somewhere in the Italian
lake country‚ÄîBarbara and her mother and my
great-uncle Stephen and his friend. One day
the friend persuaded Barbara to go out rowing
with him. There was a storm and the boat upset,
and Barbara was drowned. It was said that
the friend and the boatman swam ashore and
left her, but that is hard to believe. Anyway,
when my uncle got the news, something snapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
in his brain and he killed the boatman with an
oar. The friend made his escape and the flight
proved to the authorities that he had committed
the crime. The Ten Eycks all knew that Uncle
Stephen had done it, but it seemed of little use,
I suppose, to tell the truth, because the slayer,
Uncle Stephen, had gone clean crazy, and his
friend could not be found. They have never
seen each other since, until‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Stephen paused.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúUntil when, Stephen?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúUntil to-night, Barbara. Can you guess
who the friend is?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe hermit?‚Äù asked Barbara, with growing
excitement.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Stephen; ‚Äúthe poor old hermit
who has lived near his friend all these years
without ever letting anybody know.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd your uncle has been living in the right
wing ever since?‚Äù asked Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes. It was his father‚Äôs wish that the right
wing be absolutely his for life and that the secret
be kept in the family. The old fellow has
never hurt a fly since the night he killed the
Italian boatman. His attendant is as old as he,
almost, and sometimes Uncle Stephen gets away
from him. Have you ever seen him?‚Äù Stephen
looked at her curiously.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Bab, ‚Äúseveral times.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd never mentioned it? Really Bab, you
are great.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I finally did tell the girls, only last night.
I was just a little frightened. Your Uncle
Stephen called me by name. But, by the way,
none of you knew about the name before. How
was that?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTo tell the truth, I had never heard the
girl‚Äôs name in my life, and it was so long ago
that Uncle Stephen had forgotten it. It was
the hermit who revealed the whole thing. He
took refuge here from the fire, and after you
girls had gone upstairs he sent for Uncle John.
It seems the hermit has been with Uncle Stephen
most of the afternoon, keeping him quiet and
away from the fire. The poor old fellow was
scared, he said, but he is himself again and they
both want to see you. But that is not the chief
reason you are sent for. Uncle Stephen insists
that he has something he will tell only to you.
All day long he has been calling for you, and
Uncle John Ten Eyck thinks it may quiet him
if you will consent to see him for a few minutes.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The two had paused outside of a door at the
end of the passage, to finish the conversation,
while Mary and John had gone quietly inside.
Presently John opened the door.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, sir,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou
and the young lady may come in.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
They entered a large room, furnished with
heavy old-fashioned chairs and tables. There
were bowls of flowers about and Bab heard
afterwards that the poor, crazed old man loved
flowers and arranged them himself. Standing
near the window was the hermit. When he saw
Bab his face was radiated by such a beautiful
smile that tears sprang to the girl‚Äôs eyes. Lying
on a couch, somewhat back in the shadow,
was Stephen‚Äôs uncle of the same name. His attendant,
also an old man, who had been with
him from the beginning, was sitting beside him.
</p>
<p>
Stephen Ten Eyck the elder opened his eyes
when the door closed. He also smiled, as the
hermit had done, and Bab felt that she could
have wept aloud for the two pathetic old men.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMy little Barbara has come back at last,‚Äù
Uncle Stephen said, taking her hand. ‚ÄúI am
very happy. And my old friend Richard, too,‚Äù
he went on, stretching the other hand toward the
hermit. ‚ÄúDick,‚Äù he went on, ‚ÄúI always loved
you so. I don‚Äôt know which I loved the most,
you or sweet Barbara here. Heaven is good to
bring me all these blessings at once. Don‚Äôt
cry, little girl,‚Äù he added, tenderly, for the
tears were rolling down Barbara‚Äôs cheeks and
dropping on his hand. ‚ÄúBut I must not forget,‚Äù
he exclaimed suddenly. ‚ÄúI have something
to tell you, Barbara, before it clouds over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
here,‚Äù he tapped his brow. ‚ÄúGo away all of
you. This is for her ears alone. It is a secret.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The others moved off to a corner of the room
and the old man went on whispering mysteriously.
‚ÄúWe were the last who saw him, you
and I. He followed me that night. Do you remember?
He fell. He is lying at the foot of
the stairs now. There is a gash in his head and‚Äîblood!‚Äù
‚ÄúPress the panel in the attic‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
The old man‚Äôs voice died away in a gasp.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhich panel?‚Äù asked Bab, in an agony for
fear he would not finish.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe one with the knot hole in the right hand
corner,‚Äù he added and fell back on the couch.
</p>
<p>
Bab tried to make him tell more, but his mind
was clouded over and he had already forgotten
she was there.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHas he finished?‚Äù asked Stephen.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Bab, ‚Äúbut come quickly. We
have no time to lose. Jos√© is lying somewhere,
dead or half dead, in the secret passage.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Too much excited and amazed to say good-night
to the hermit, the callers rushed down the
passage, followed by the two servants. At the
foot of the attic stairs they waited while John
brought lights, and for the second time that day
Bab climbed into the vast old attic.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThank fortune the partition is down,‚Äù exclaimed
Stephen. ‚ÄúI suppose Uncle Stephen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
forgot to slide it back, he was in such a hurry
to get away from Jos√©.‚Äù Bab had explained
the situation, to Stephen while they waited for
the candles. ‚ÄúWhich panel did he say, Bab?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis must be it,‚Äù she answered; ‚Äúthe panel
in the right-hand corner that has a knot hole in
it. Here is the knot hole all right. We are to
press it, he said.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
They pressed, but nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPress the knot hole, why don‚Äôt you?‚Äù suggested
Bab.
</p>
<p>
One touch was enough. The panel opened
and disclosed a long passage cut apparently
through the wall. There were several branch
passages leading off from the main one, marked
with faded handwriting on slips of paper, one
‚ÄúTo the Cellar,‚Äù another ‚ÄúTo the Library‚Äù and
finally the last one ‚ÄúTo the Right Wing.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThis must be the one,‚Äù said Stephen, as
they groped their way along single file. ‚ÄúBe
careful,‚Äù he called; ‚Äúthere should be a flight
of steps along here somewhere.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Presently they came to the steps. Up through
the dense blackness they could faintly hear a
sound of moaning.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAll right, Jos√©, old fellow, we are coming to
you,‚Äù cried Stephen, while Bab‚Äôs heart beat so
loud she could not trust herself to speak.
</p>
<p>
Groping their way down the narrow stairway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
they came to a landing almost on a level with
the ceilings of the first floor rooms. At the far
end of the passage they could hear a voice calling
faintly.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe probably fell the length of the steps, and
dragged himself across,‚Äù exclaimed Stephen,
holding his lantern high above his head.
</p>
<p>
They found Jos√© stretched out by a narrow
door opening directly into the right wing. There
was a gash just above his temple which he himself
had bound with his handkerchief and his
leg appeared to be broken at the ankle.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√©, my poor boy,‚Äù cried Stephen, ‚Äúwe
have found you at last!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Jos√© smiled weakly and fainted dead away.
</p>
<p>
The two men carried him back up the flight
of steps, not daring to try the experiment of the
passage leading to the library.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI suppose Uncle Stephen has known these
passages since he was a child,‚Äù said Stephen in
a low voice to Bab as they passed through the
attic, ‚Äúand when his attendant is asleep, no
doubt he steals off and wanders about the house.
I believe he has always had a mania that he was
being pursued by the Italian boatman; and when
Jos√© followed him, right on top of his meeting
with you, it was too much for the old fellow.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a dear old man,‚Äù returned Bab, ‚Äúand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
how he must have suffered all these years; that
is, whenever his memory returned.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd think of the hermit, too, who sacrificed
his entire career for you, Miss, just because you
never learned to swim.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Bab smiled. ‚ÄúIf my Aunt Barbara had lived
by the sea as I have, she would never have had
to wait for boatmen and lovers to pull her out
of the deep water. Swimming is as easy as
walking to me.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am glad you‚Äôve learned wisdom in your
old age,‚Äù replied Stephen as they paused at the
door of the bedroom given to Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere is one thing I cannot believe,‚Äù declared
Bab, ‚Äúand that is that the hermit swam
off and left Aunt Barbara to drown.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWho knows?‚Äù answered Stephen. ‚ÄúPeople
lose their heads strangely sometimes.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
It was Alfred, destined to be a great doctor,
who set Jos√©‚Äôs leg that night.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV‚ÄîGOOD-BYE TO TEN EYCK HALL</h2>
<p>
Four days had passed since the exciting
happenings of that eventful day that had
begun with the disappearance of Jos√©,
and had ended with his discovery.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have much to be thankful for,‚Äù said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
major to Miss Sallie, who was reclining in a
steamer chair on the piazza. She had not left
her bed until the afternoon of the third day, and
was still a little shaky and nervous.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think what they are, John,‚Äù she replied
severely. ‚ÄúYou have had nothing but
misfortunes since we came to stay under your
roof. I hope they may end when we leave.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe first one,‚Äù said the major, smiling good-humoredly,
‚Äúis that I have had the privilege of
knowing how splendid American women can be
in time of danger. I always admired the women
of my country, but never so much as now,‚Äù he
added, looking fondly at his old friend.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù assented Miss Sallie proudly, ‚Äúmy
girls are about as fine as any to be found in the
world, I think. They are wholesome, sensible,
and never cowardly. Undoubtedly they saved
Ten Eyck Hall for you, Major, by their combined
efforts, and by Bab‚Äôs bravery in watering the
roof when the sparks began to fly.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou were just as wonderful as the girls,
Sallie, my dear. They tell me you superintended
the digging of the trench and managed
your men with the coolness of a general; and
that when the fire leaped over the trench you
were there with the bucket brigade to put it out.
The girls were no whit less courageous in your
day than they are now, Sallie.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd what is the second blessing you have to
be thankful for, John?‚Äù interrupted Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat Jos√© is the boy I took him to be‚Äîa
good, honest, noble fellow.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI must say I liked him from the first moment
I set eyes upon him,‚Äù said Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù continued the major; ‚Äúhis father
might well be proud of him. He deserves the
highest commendation for his forbearance and
unselfishness in regard to that brother of his.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow is the brother, by the way?‚Äù asked
Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou know he was taken to the hospital the
day after he was brought here; well, the boys
went over in the car yesterday. Antonio is
much better. His sister is tending him. He is
very repentant, she says, and has consented to
go to school and turn over a new leaf. In fact,
I myself have had a long talk with him. I can
see that there is great good in the boy. It has
simply been perverted by evil associations.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAh, Major,‚Äù exclaimed his old friend, smiling
indulgently as she tapped his arm with her
fan, ‚Äúyou are truly the most optimistic soul in
the world. I hope all your golden dreams about
this wretched boy‚Äôs future will come true. But
what about his sister!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√© is anxious for her to go to a school in
America. He believes she could not endure the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
restraint of a European school after her free,
open-air life. She is only too anxious. She
wants to cultivate her voice, and the old grandmother
appears really relieved at the turn affairs
have taken. She was willing to concede
anything to keep the grandson out of jail.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThen my Ruth will not be able to gratify
her whim to educate the Gypsy girl,‚Äù pursued
Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù replied the major. ‚ÄúJos√©‚Äôs
father is very well-to-do, as the world goes, but
Ruth is to take charge of Zerlina‚Äôs education
and look after her generally. She has asked
Jos√© to allow her that privilege, as she put it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Just then the girls came around the corner of
the piazza, after a stroll in the garden.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow fresh and delicious the air is since the
rain!‚Äù exclaimed Barbara. ‚ÄúThere is still a
faint smell of burning. Do you think all the
trees in the forest will die, Major?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOld Adam says they will not,‚Äù answered the
major. ‚ÄúA three months‚Äô unbroken drought
will dry up almost anything but trees. Now,
while the underbrush and dried fern burned like
tinder, the fire hardly touched the trees. It was
those dead bramble hedges dividing the fields
and the dried meadow grass that did the most
damage, because the sparks from them ignited
the garage and the roof of the stable.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am glad papa and Mrs. Thurston were not
uneasy about us,‚Äù observed Ruth. ‚ÄúIf they had
read the papers before you telegraphed, Major,
they would have been frantic, I suppose.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMake way for the Duke of Granada,‚Äù called
Jimmie‚Äôs cheerful voice from the hall, and presently
he appeared, pushing Jos√©, done up in bandages
and lying flat on his back, on a rolling cot
used by some invalid of the Ten Eyck family
long since dead and gone.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJos√©, my boy,‚Äù exclaimed the major, going
to the foot of the cot to ease it as it passed over
the door sill, ‚Äúdo you think this is safe?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe doctor says it will not hurt him,‚Äù replied
Jimmie. ‚ÄúHe needs company, but we
won‚Äôt let him stay long.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Jos√© smiled up at the faces leaning over him.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou have all been so good to me,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI want to thank you for your kindness and for
believing in me when my character looked black
enough to have condemned me without any more
proof. And I want to thank you for my brother,
too, and my poor little sister.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
His eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThere, there,‚Äù cried the major, pressing the
boy‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little enough we have done,
I‚Äôm sure. I only wish we could have saved you
from your tumble,‚Äù he added, gazing sadly
toward the right wing of Ten Eyck Hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAnd is it really true that our friends are going
to leave us this afternoon?‚Äù asked Jos√©.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answered the major; ‚Äúall our girls
and boys are going. We shall be lonesome
enough when they are gone.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was the sound of a motor horn down
the avenue.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAh, here comes Stephen at last. I was afraid
he would be late,‚Äù said Major Ten Eyck, as his
automobile pulled up at the door and Stephen,
Martin and Alfred jumped out.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got them, uncle,‚Äù cried Stephen.
‚ÄúThey arrived this morning.‚Äù And he handed
his uncle a registered package carefully done
up and sealed with red sealing wax.
</p>
<p>
The major took the box and disappeared into
the house while the boys exchanged significant
looks.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen,‚Äù said Bab, as they strolled down
to the end of the-piazza while the others were
examining the morning papers and reading their
mail, ‚Äúdid you ever ask Jos√© where he was the
morning we went to see the hermit!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù replied her friend; ‚Äúor, rather,
he told me without being asked. He was to meet
his brother by appointment at the haunted pool.
I suppose he was there too soon, because Antonio
chose to inflict us with his antics before he
went to see Jos√©, who heard a great deal of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
nonsense, so he said, and there was a quarrel
afterwards, a very bitter one, and Jos√© threatened
to give Antonio over to the authorities unless
he consented to give up his lawless life.
Zerlina was hovering around later, and heard
the pistol shots after the fight with the tramps.
She thought, of course, it was a duel between
her two brothers. That is why she paid you
the mysterious visit and tried to read the note.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHow does Antonio strike you?‚Äù asked Bab.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJust as a mischievous boy might. I think he
will outgrow his vicious tendencies now that he
has been taken hold of. For one thing he no
longer hates poor old Jos√©. I told him, plainly,
what a fine fellow his brother was, and that it
was only on Jos√©‚Äôs account we were not going
to have him arrested. He seemed to be a good
deal impressed, I think.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúA note for you, Miss,‚Äù said John, handing
Bab a three-cornered missive on a tray.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWill Miss Barbara Thurston grant one last
interview to an old admirer?‚Äù the note ran.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from your great-uncle,‚Äù exclaimed Bab,
giving Stephen the note to read.
</p>
<p>
Stephen smiled as his eye took in the crabbed,
old-fashioned handwriting.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe poor old fellow can‚Äôt quite get the
proper focus as to who you really are,‚Äù he
said. ‚ÄúYou appear to represent two Barbaras
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
to him. But you will go over for a few minutes,
won‚Äôt you, Bab? I doubt if Uncle Stephen will
last much longer, and seeing you may be a great
comfort to him.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOf course I will,‚Äù Bab replied. ‚ÄúIf seeing
me can bring a ray of pleasure into his life, I am
glad enough to be able to do it. I should like
to take him a few flowers. I know he loves them.
Suppose we get some honeysuckle and late roses
out of the garden before we go.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Together they strolled toward the major‚Äôs
garden, which the flames had spared, partly because
it was protected by a high brick wall on
three sides, and partly owing to a daily watering
it had received from the gardener.
</p>
<p>
With Stephen‚Äôs penknife they clipped a bunch
of dewy white roses with yellow centers, and a
few sprays of honeysuckle whose fragrance was
overpoweringly sweet.
</p>
<p>
The old man was watching for the young people
at the window when the attendant opened
the door for them. He came forward with some
of the major‚Äôs grace and took Barbara‚Äôs hand
in his.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt was very good of you to come,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI heard you were going, and I wanted to say
a last good-bye. I feel happier than I have felt
in many years. You have forgiven me, have
you not, little Barbara?‚Äù he went on, his mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
confusing her again with that other Barbara
whose tragic death had bereft him of his reason.
‚ÄúAnd you have brought me the roses,
too?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
She nodded her head.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDid they come from the bush near the arbor?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she replied, wondering a little.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember that it was our bush,
the one we chose when you were here on a visit?
Our white rose bush, Barbara. That you
should not have forgotten, after all these years!‚Äù
Then his memory came back. ‚ÄúBut what am
I saying?‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúMy mind often gets
confused. It was the likeness, I suppose. I
want you to see this portrait of your grand-aunt.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
He went over to a desk near the window and
drew from one of its drawers an old daguerreotype.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is very, very like,‚Äù he murmured, as he
handed it to Barbara.
</p>
<p>
It was, indeed, even more like the present Bab
than the miniature which the hermit had treasured
during his years of solitude.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI want you to keep this picture, Barbara,‚Äù
said Stephen‚Äôs uncle. ‚ÄúI have another one, and
it will be a pleasure to me, at the last, to know
that it belongs to another Barbara Thurston.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
This ring must also be yours.‚Äù He drew from
the desk a little black velvet case. ‚ÄúIt was a
ring I gave to her after we were engaged. Will
you wear it for me!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Barbara opened the case and slipped the ring
on her finger. It was a very old ring of beaten
silver with a sapphire setting.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said and gave him her
hand.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGood-bye, little Barbara!‚Äù cried the old
man. ‚ÄúYou have brought peace to me at last.
You and my dear friend, Richard. I have
changed a great deal, you see,‚Äù he was lapsing
back into the old mania, ‚Äúbut you are as young
and pretty as ever, Barbara.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is time to go,‚Äù whispered Stephen, hurriedly.
The attendant had already opened the
door for them and they slipped out together.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe hermit has promised to come and see
him every day,‚Äù said Stephen, as they hastened
through the passage. ‚ÄúIndeed, Uncle John has
invited the hermit to live at Ten Eyck Hall for
the rest of his days, and he has all but consented.
He is a wonderful old man, I think, and whether
he swam off and left ‚Äòyou‚Äô or not, he has atoned
for it after all these years.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen,‚Äù replied Barbara, ‚ÄúI shall never
believe that he did that, no matter if he were to
tell me so himself.‚Äù
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
They reached the piazza just in time to hear
Miss Sallie saying:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGirls, I think we had better go up and get
ready for the trip, before luncheon is announced.
We want to start promptly, this time, even if
we shall have such an excellent guard of young
men. Jos√©, I am sorry you are not well enough
to come in to our last meal,‚Äù she added, turning
to the sick boy and taking his hand. ‚ÄúBut we
shall run up and say good-bye to you before we
leave, and if ever you go as far west as Chicago,
I want you to come and see us. Perhaps Ruth
and I shall see you and your father this autumn
when we are in Europe.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIndeed, I hope you will come to Madrid and
visit at my home,‚Äù cried Jos√©. ‚ÄúWill you not
arrange it?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThat would be delightful‚Äù said Miss Sallie,
‚Äúbut we shall be over only for six weeks. We
must return in time for Ruth‚Äôs school, you
know.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The last luncheon at Ten Eyck Hall was a
very gay one. The dangers of the previous
week were over and the mysteries cleared away.
</p>
<p>
The major fairly beamed on his guests across
the hospitable board.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt must have been Miss Sallie‚Äôs fault,‚Äù
thought Mollie, watching his handsome face
with a secret admiration. ‚ÄúHe is certainly the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
dearest old man alive. I wonder if she isn‚Äôt
sorry now?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And as if in answer to her unspoken question,
she heard Miss Sallie saying:
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúJohn, I hope this is not the last visit you will
let us make to Ten Eyck Hall. In spite of its
fires and tramps I should like to come again.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI should be the happiest man in the world
if you only would,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúI am greatly
relieved that you haven‚Äôt got an everlasting
prejudice against it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhen I settle down for the winter,‚Äù Jimmie
Butler was heard to remark above the hum of
conversation, ‚ÄúI mean to take up a certain study
and not leave off studying it until I have graduated
with diploma and honors.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWhat is it, Jimmie?‚Äù demanded the others.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúPrize fighting,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúI intend to
learn wrestling and boxing, likewise just plain
hair-pulling and scratching. Prize fighting in
all its varieties for me before another year rolls
round.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou will have to go into training, then,
Jim,‚Äù exclaimed Alfred. ‚ÄúYou will not be permitted
to eat anything you like and not too
much of anything else.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo more hot bread for you, Jimmie,‚Äù continued
Stephen. ‚ÄúNo more waffles and Johnnie-cakes.
You will have to punch the bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
mornings, when you would rather be sleeping,
and give up theatres in the evenings for early
bedtime. It‚Äôs a fearful life, my boy.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBe that as it may,‚Äù persisted Jimmie, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
going to learn how to deal a blow that will give
a man a black eye the first time, and if ever I
get hold of that wiry individual who gave me
these in the woods, yonder,‚Äù he pointed to his
red nose and discolored eye, ‚Äúhe‚Äôll get such a
‚Äòlicking‚Äô as he‚Äôll remember to his last hour.
Even Stephen‚Äôs giant won‚Äôt be a match for me.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was joyous laughter at this, followed by
remarks from Martin and Alfred of a rather
sarcastic character, such as ‚ÄúGive it to him, Jimmie!
Give him a bump in the ribs!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI am going to have the woods patrolled, hereafter,
in the summer time,‚Äù observed the major,
‚Äúand all dangerous characters will be excluded.
The next time we have a house party there will
be no tramps to threaten my guests.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù said Stephen, ‚Äúthe giant
tramp is in the hospital now. He was drunk
when the fire started, and fell asleep. He was
badly burned and almost suffocated, but his
poor, long-suffering wife managed to save him
somehow. The other two had left him to die.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWill you have him arrested when he gets
well, Major?‚Äù asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied the major, somewhat confused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
‚ÄúI suppose I should, but he tells me he was despoiled
of his living by a dishonest master, and
I have concluded to make it up to him for being
richer than he is by giving him something to do.
We have several farms back in the country and
I have put him in charge of the smallest one. It
seems that farming is the very thing he wants
to do more than anything else in life. He will
have to travel a good distance before he can get
anything to drink, and his wife is the happiest
woman over the prospect you ever saw.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúMajor, major!‚Äù protested Miss Sallie.
‚ÄúWhat will you do next?‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúAh, well,‚Äù exclaimed the major, ‚Äúit is good
to be able to give a man a chance to earn an honest
living, especially if he wants to take it. And,
when this poor wretch heard about that bit of
land and little cottage back yonder in the hills,
he looked as if he had had a glimpse of heaven.
His wife told me that he had really tried, again
and again to find something to do; but indoor
life was very irksome to him because he had been
brought up on a farm, and working in factories
and foundries had been his undoing.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúStephen, how do you feel about it?‚Äù asked
Alfred. ‚ÄúHe was your opponent in the fight,
you know.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù replied Stephen. ‚ÄúHe
didn‚Äôt give me a black eye, and I am glad for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
him to earn an honest living. Uncle‚Äôs a
brick.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
When the meal was over Major Ten Eyck rose
from the table, clearing his throat as if he were
about to make a speech, which indeed he was.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI have something to say before this party
breaks up, for myself and the boys. We want
to express to you, how deeply grateful we feel to
you, Miss Sallie and ‚ÄòThe Automobile Girls,‚Äô
for what you have done for us.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou have saved our old home for us, at the
risk of your own precious lives, and there is
nothing we can really do or say to show how
much we appreciate it. The place has been in
the family ever since there were any Ten Eycks
to live in it. I was born here and I love it, and
I hope to end my days here‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt speak as if you were on the brink of
the grave, Major, I beg of you,‚Äù protested Miss
Sallie. ‚ÄúYou are not many years older than I
am, and I certainly will not allow such mournful
thoughts to trouble me so soon.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou will always be young, Sallie,‚Äù replied
the gallant major.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúYou are nothing but a boy yourself, John,‚Äù
replied Miss Stuart, blushing in spite of herself,
while the young people exchanged stealthy
smiles at these elderly compliments.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI was saying,‚Äù continued the major, who remained standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
to finish his speech, ‚Äúthat there
was nothing we could do, the boys and I, to show
how we feel in this matter. But when you wear
these little ornaments‚Äù (here the major handed
Miss Sallie and each of the girls a little jeweler‚Äôs
box) ‚Äúwe hope you will remember that we are
your devoted friends always. It was Stephen‚Äôs
idea, and there was not much time to get them,
but the jeweler undertook a rush order for us,
and I hope they are all right.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHurray!‚Äù cried Jimmie, rolling his napkin
into a ball and tossing it into the air.
</p>
<p>
There were cries of pleasure when the boxes
gave up their treasures, small gold firemen‚Äôs helmets
studded with pearls and a row of rubies on
the curve of the brim.
</p>
<p>
As if this were not enough, John came in with
a tray of bouquets, each one different, as on a
former occasion. The major had picked and arranged
the flowers himself for Miss Sallie and
‚ÄúThe Automobile Girls,‚Äù as a last reminder of
Ten Eyck Hall, he said.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúIt is worth while going into the firemen‚Äôs
business, if one is to be so well repaid,‚Äù exclaimed
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Bab felt particularly rich in souvenirs of
her visit, with a picture of a new and hitherto
unknown great-aunt, a ring and a beautiful
pin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe are all much too excited to thank you
properly, Major,‚Äù she said.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any thanks, my dear child,‚Äù
replied the major. ‚ÄúI wish to avoid them.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúSomebody should make a speech,‚Äù cried
Jimmie‚Äôs voice above the jollity. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll
be the one.‚Äù He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúMajor
John Ten Eyck,‚Äù he said bowing toward the
major, ‚ÄúI know these young ladies appreciate
deeply the handsome souvenirs you have bestowed
upon them, but youth and inexperience
have tied their tongues. However, mine is
loosened and I wish to thank you a thousand
times for the souvenirs which I also am carrying
away from Ten Eyck Hall, namely my beautiful
ruby nose and my blue enameled eyes.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There was more laughter and more exchange
of jokes and fun, when Martin who had slipped
out of the room for a moment, returned with a
small bundle which he handed to Jimmie.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll give you a booby prize, Jimmie,‚Äù he
said, ‚Äúsince the ladies have been awarded the
first prize.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Jimmie opened the bundle and drew forth a
boxing glove which he put on immediately and
chased Martin out of the room. This was the
signal for the breaking up of the lunch party.
</p>
<p>
The boxes and suit cases were already piled
in their accustomed place on the back of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
car and there was nothing for the girls to do but
to pin on their hats and veils, slip on their silk
dusters and go.
</p>
<p>
The servants had lined up in the hall to say
good-bye. Jos√© had begged to be permitted to
remain downstairs until after the visitors had
gone. As the automobiles sped down the
avenue, the major, standing by the sick boy‚Äôs
cot, waved good-bye from the piazza.
</p>
<p>
Only Bab saw another handkerchief waving
its pathetic farewell from a window in the right
wing. She gave an answering wave with her
own little handkerchief which she hoped the old
man would not miss.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúGood-bye to Ten Eyck Hall,‚Äù she said to
herself as she looked back at the beautiful old
house. ‚ÄúYou are full of tragic memories, but
I love you and I would have risked much to have
saved you from crumbling to a heap of ashes.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
As they passed over the bridge and came to
the crossroads by the woods, they were stopped
by blind Jennie, who silently presented Bab and
Ruth each with a small cross she herself had
carved from wood. Then to Bab she gave a
beautiful bunch of yellow roses, which the hermit
had begged the girl to accept with his best
wishes.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV‚ÄîCONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
In spite of the strange chain of events following
so closely on each other‚Äôs heels, ‚ÄúThe
Automobile Girls‚Äù had only pleasant memories
of Ten Eyck Hall and its occupants.
</p>
<p>
Among their trips they counted this as one
of the most interesting, but Ruth, who was ever
planning future surprises, had a plan that would
outdo all other visits. This was nothing less
than a journey to her own home, Chicago.
</p>
<p>
This excursion, every moment of which was
to throb with interest for our four girls, involved
the attempt to discover a hidden treasure
buried in what had once been the prairie home
of an old Illinois family. These adventures, with
exciting scenes on the Stock Exchange where
Barbara Thurston learned of a plot to ruin her
friends, and much more, all is vividly described
in the next volume of this series:

Really good and new stories for boys and girls are not

to bring a grin of derision to the young reader‚Äôs face before
he has gone far. The name of ALTEMUS is a distinctive

the buyer of having a book that is up-to-date and fine
throughout. No buyer of an ALTEMUS book is ever
disappointed.
</p>
<p>
Many are the claims made as to the inexpensiveness
of books. Go into any bookstore and ask for an Altemus
book. Compare the price charged you for Altemus
books with the price demanded for other juvenile books.
You will at once discover that a given outlay of money

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
